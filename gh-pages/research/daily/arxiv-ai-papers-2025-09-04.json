    "title": "Foundations and Models in Modern Computer Vision: Key Building Blocks in   Landmark Architectures",
    "summary": "This report analyzes the evolution of key design patterns in computer vision\nby examining six influential papers. The analysis begins with foundational\narchitectures for image recognition. We review ResNet, which introduced\nresidual connections to overcome the vanishing gradient problem and enable\neffective training of significantly deeper convolutional networks.\nSubsequently, we examine the Vision Transformer (ViT), which established a new\nparadigm by applying the Transformer architecture to sequences of image\npatches, demonstrating the efficacy of attention-based models for large-scale\nimage recognition. Building on these visual representation backbones, we\ninvestigate generative models. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are\nanalyzed for their novel adversarial training process, which challenges a\ngenerator against a discriminator to learn complex data distributions. Then,\nLatent Diffusion Models (LDMs) are covered, which improve upon prior generative\nmethods by performing a sequential denoising process in a perceptually\ncompressed latent space. LDMs achieve high-fidelity synthesis with greater\ncomputational efficiency, representing the current state-of-the-art for image\ngeneration. Finally, we explore self-supervised learning techniques that reduce\ndependency on labeled data. DINO is a self-distillation framework in which a\nstudent network learns to match the output of a momentum-updated teacher,\nyielding features with strong k-NN classification performance. We conclude with\nMasked Autoencoders (MAE), which utilize an asymmetric encoder-decoder design\nto reconstruct heavily masked inputs, providing a highly scalable and effective\nmethod for pre-training large-scale vision models.",

To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose Attn-Adapter, a novel online few-shot learning\nframework that enhances CLIP's adaptability via a dual attention mechanism. Our\ndesign incorporates dataset-specific information through two components: the\nMemory Attn-Adapter, which refines category embeddings using support examples,\nand the Local-Global Attn-Adapter, which enriches image embeddings by\nintegrating local and global features.

In this\nstudy, we present a survey on existing Arabic chatbots in education and their\ndifferent characteristics such as the adopted approaches, language variety, and\nmetrics used to measure their performance.

    "summary": "Selecting a sample generation scheme from multiple prompt-based generative\nmodels, including large language models (LLMs) and prompt-guided image and\nvideo generation models, is typically addressed by choosing the model that\nmaximizes an averaged evaluation score. However, this score-based selection\noverlooks the possibility that different models achieve the best generation\nperformance for different types of text prompts. An online identification of\nthe best generation model for various input prompts can reduce the costs\nassociated with querying sub-optimal models. In this work, we explore the\npossibility of varying rankings of text-based generative models for different\ntext prompts and propose an online learning framework to predict the best data\ngeneration model for a given input prompt. The proposed PAK-UCB algorithm\naddresses a contextual bandit (CB) setting with shared context variables across\nthe arms, utilizing the generated data to update kernel-based functions that\npredict the score of each model available for unseen text prompts.\nAdditionally, we leverage random Fourier features (RFF) to accelerate the\nonline learning process of PAK-UCB. Our numerical experiments on real and\nsimulated text-to-image and image-to-text generative models show that RFF-UCB\nperforms successfully in identifying the best generation model across different\nsample types.

    "title": "SMooGPT: Stylized Motion Generation using Large Language Models",
    "summary": "Stylized motion generation is actively studied in computer graphics,\nespecially benefiting from the rapid advances in diffusion models. The goal of\nthis task is to produce a novel motion respecting both the motion content and\nthe desired motion style, e.g., ``walking in a loop like a Monkey''. Existing\nresearch attempts to address this problem via motion style transfer or\nconditional motion generation. They typically embed the motion style into a\nlatent space and guide the motion implicitly in a latent space as well. Despite\nthe progress, their methods suffer from low interpretability and control,\nlimited generalization to new styles, and fail to produce motions other than\n``walking'' due to the strong bias in the public stylization dataset. In this\npaper, we propose to solve the stylized motion generation problem from a new\nperspective of reasoning-composition-generation, based on our observations: i)\nhuman motion can often be effectively described using natural language in a\nbody-part centric manner, ii) LLMs exhibit a strong ability to understand and\nreason about human motion, and iii) human motion has an inherently\ncompositional nature, facilitating the new motion content or style generation\nvia effective recomposing. We thus propose utilizing body-part text space as an\nintermediate representation, and present SMooGPT, a fine-tuned LLM, acting as a\nreasoner, composer, and generator when generating the desired stylized motion.\nOur method executes in the body-part text space with much higher\ninterpretability, enabling fine-grained motion control, effectively resolving\npotential conflicts between motion content and style, and generalizes well to\nnew styles thanks to the open-vocabulary ability of LLMs. Comprehensive\nexperiments and evaluations, and a user perceptual study, demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach, especially under the pure text-driven stylized\nmotion generation.",

    "summary": "This paper introduces MiniCPM4, a highly efficient large language model (LLM)\ndesigned explicitly for end-side devices. We achieve this efficiency through\nsystematic innovation in four key dimensions: model architecture, training\ndata, training algorithms, and inference systems. Specifically, in terms of\nmodel architecture, we propose InfLLM v2, a trainable sparse attention\nmechanism that accelerates both prefilling and decoding phases for long-context\nprocessing. Regarding training data, we propose UltraClean, an efficient and\naccurate pre-training data filtering and generation strategy, and UltraChat v2,\na comprehensive supervised fine-tuning dataset. These datasets enable\nsatisfactory model performance to be achieved using just 8 trillion training\ntokens. Regarding training algorithms, we propose ModelTunnel v2 for efficient\npre-training strategy search, and improve existing post-training methods by\nintroducing chunk-wise rollout for load-balanced reinforcement learning and\ndata-efficient tenary LLM, BitCPM. Regarding inference systems, we propose\nCPM.cu that integrates sparse attention, model quantization, and speculative\nsampling to achieve efficient prefilling and decoding. To meet diverse\non-device requirements, MiniCPM4 is available in two versions, with 0.5B and 8B\nparameters, respectively. Furthermore, we construct a hybrid reasoning model,\nMiniCPM4.1, which can be used in both deep reasoning mode and non-reasoning\nmode. Evaluation results demonstrate that MiniCPM4 and MiniCPM4.1 outperform\nsimilar-sized open-source models across benchmarks, with the 8B variants\nshowing significant speed improvements on long sequence understanding and\ngeneration.",

    "summary": "Due to their powerful feature association capabilities, neural network-based\ncomputer vision models have the ability to detect and exploit unintended\npatterns within the data, potentially leading to correct predictions based on\nincorrect or unintended but statistically relevant signals. These clues may\nvary from simple color aberrations to small texts within the image. In\nsituations where these unintended signals align with the predictive task,\nmodels can mistakenly link these features with the task and rely on them for\nmaking predictions. This phenomenon is referred to as spurious correlations,\nwhere patterns appear to be associated with the task but are actually\ncoincidental. As a result, detection and mitigation of spurious correlations\nhave become crucial tasks for building trustworthy, reliable, and generalizable\nmachine learning models. In this work, we present a novel method to detect\nspurious correlations in vision transformers, a type of neural network\narchitecture that gained significant popularity in recent years. Using both\nsupervised and self-supervised trained models, we present large-scale\nexperiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrating the ability of the proposed\nmethod to identify spurious correlations. We also find that, even if the same\narchitecture is used, the training methodology has a significant impact on the\nmodel's reliance on spurious correlations. Furthermore, we show that certain\nclasses in the ImageNet dataset contain spurious signals that are easily\ndetected by the models and discuss the underlying reasons for those spurious\nsignals. In light of our findings, we provide an exhaustive list of the\naforementioned images and call for caution in their use in future research\nefforts. Lastly, we present a case study investigating spurious signals in\ninvasive breast mass classification, grounding our work in real-world\nscenarios.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward (RLVR) has become a promising\nparadigm for post-training large language models (LLMs) to improve their\nreasoning capability. However, when the rollout accuracy is low on hard\nproblems, the reward becomes sparse, limiting learning efficiency and causing\nexploration bottlenecks. Existing approaches either rely on stronger LLMs for\ndistillation or filter out difficult problems, which limits scalability or\nrestricts reasoning improvement through exploration.\n  We propose EvoCoT, a self-evolving curriculum learning framework based on\ntwo-stage chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning optimization. EvoCoT constrains the\nexploration space by self-generating and verifying CoT trajectories, then\ngradually shortens them to expand the space in a controlled way. This enables\nLLMs to stably learn from initially unsolved hard problems under sparse\nrewards. We apply EvoCoT to multiple LLM families, including Qwen, DeepSeek,\nand Llama. Experiments show that EvoCoT enables LLMs to solve previously\nunsolved problems, improves reasoning capability without external CoT\nsupervision, and is compatible with various RL fine-tuning methods.

    "summary": "Objective. Motion artifacts in brain MRI, mainly from rigid head motion,\ndegrade image quality and hinder downstream applications. Conventional methods\nto mitigate these artifacts, including repeated acquisitions or motion\ntracking, impose workflow burdens. This study introduces Res-MoCoDiff, an\nefficient denoising diffusion probabilistic model specifically designed for MRI\nmotion artifact correction.Approach.Res-MoCoDiff exploits a novel residual\nerror shifting mechanism during the forward diffusion process to incorporate\ninformation from motion-corrupted images. This mechanism allows the model to\nsimulate the evolution of noise with a probability distribution closely\nmatching that of the corrupted data, enabling a reverse diffusion process that\nrequires only four steps. The model employs a U-net backbone, with attention\nlayers replaced by Swin Transformer blocks, to enhance robustness across\nresolutions. Furthermore, the training process integrates a combined l1+l2 loss\nfunction, which promotes image sharpness and reduces pixel-level errors.\nRes-MoCoDiff was evaluated on both an in-silico dataset generated using a\nrealistic motion simulation framework and an in-vivo MR-ART dataset.\nComparative analyses were conducted against established methods, including\nCycleGAN, Pix2pix, and a diffusion model with a vision transformer backbone,\nusing quantitative metrics such as PSNR, SSIM, and NMSE.Main results. The\nproposed method demonstrated superior performance in removing motion artifacts\nacross minor, moderate, and heavy distortion levels. Res-MoCoDiff consistently\nachieved the highest SSIM and the lowest NMSE values, with a PSNR of up to\n41.91+-2.94 dB for minor distortions. Notably, the average sampling time was\nreduced to 0.37 seconds per batch of two image slices, compared with 101.74\nseconds for conventional approaches.",

In recent years, pretrained Multimodal Large Language\nModels (MLLMs) have advanced rapidly, leading to a significant increase in\nimage aesthetics research that integrates both visual and textual modalities.\nHowever, most existing studies on image aesthetics primarily focus on\npredicting aesthetic ratings and have shown limited application in AIC.\nExisting AIC works leveraging MLLMs predominantly rely on fine-tuning methods\nwithout specifically adapting MLLMs to focus on target aesthetic content. To\naddress this limitation, we propose the Aesthetic Saliency Enhanced Multimodal\nLarge Language Model (ASE-MLLM), an end-to-end framework that explicitly\nincorporates aesthetic saliency into MLLMs. Within this framework, we introduce\nthe Image Aesthetic Saliency Module (IASM), which efficiently and effectively\nextracts aesthetic saliency features from images.

To the\nbest of our knowledge, ASE-MLLM is the first framework to integrate image\naesthetic saliency into MLLMs specifically for AIC tasks.

    "summary": "The introduction of negative labels (NLs) has proven effective in enhancing\nOut-of-Distribution (OOD) detection. However, existing methods often lack an\nunderstanding of OOD images, making it difficult to construct an accurate\nnegative space. In addition, the presence of false negative labels\nsignificantly degrades their near-OOD performance. To address these issues, we\npropose shaping an Adaptive Negative Textual Space (ANTS) by leveraging the\nunderstanding and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models\n(MLLMs). Specifically, we identify images likely to be OOD samples as negative\nimages and prompt the MLLM to describe these images, generating expressive\nnegative sentences that precisely characterize the OOD distribution and enhance\nfar-OOD detection. For the near-OOD setting, where OOD samples resemble the\nin-distribution (ID) subset, we first identify the subset of ID classes that\nare visually similar to negative images and then leverage the reasoning\ncapability of MLLMs to generate visually similar negative labels tailored to\nthis subset, effectively reducing false negatives and improving near-OOD\ndetection. To balance these two types of negative textual spaces, we design an\nadaptive weighted score that enables the method to handle different OOD task\nsettings (near-OOD and far-OOD) without relying on task-specific prior\nknowledge, making it highly adaptable in open environments. On the ImageNet\nbenchmark, our ANTS significantly reduces the FPR95 by 4.2\\%, establishing a\nnew state-of-the-art.

To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Expert Planning and\nGen eration Framework (MEPG) that synergistically integrates position- and\nstyle-aware large language models (LLMs) with spatial-semantic expert modules.\nThe framework comprises two core components: (1) a Position-Style-Aware (PSA)\nmodule that utilizes a supervised fine-tuned LLM to decom pose input prompts\ninto precise spatial coordinates and style encoded semantic instructions; and\n(2) a Multi-Expert Dif fusion (MED) module that implements cross-region genera\ntion through dynamic expert routing across both local regions and global areas.\nDuring the generation process for each lo cal region, specialized models (e.g.,\nrealism experts, styliza tion specialists) are selectively activated for each\nspatial par tition via attention-based gating mechanisms.

    "summary": "Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) have set new benchmarks in\nsemantic segmentation. However, when adapting pretrained ViTs to new target\ndomains, significant performance degradation often occurs due to distribution\nshifts, resulting in suboptimal global attention. Since self-attention\nmechanisms are inherently data-driven, they may fail to effectively attend to\nkey objects when source and target domains exhibit differences in texture,\nscale, or object co-occurrence patterns. While global and patch-level domain\nadaptation methods provide partial solutions, region-level adaptation with\ndynamically shaped regions is crucial due to spatial heterogeneity in\ntransferability across different image areas. We present Transferable Mask\nTransformer (TMT), a novel region-level adaptation framework for semantic\nsegmentation that aligns cross-domain representations through spatial\ntransferability analysis. TMT consists of two key components: (1) An Adaptive\nCluster-based Transferability Estimator (ACTE) that dynamically segments images\ninto structurally and semantically coherent regions for localized\ntransferability assessment, and (2) A Transferable Masked Attention (TMA)\nmodule that integrates region-specific transferability maps into ViTs'\nattention mechanisms, prioritizing adaptation in regions with low\ntransferability and high semantic uncertainty. Comprehensive evaluations across\n20 cross-domain pairs demonstrate TMT's superiority, achieving an average 2%\nMIoU improvement over vanilla fine-tuning and a 1.28% increase compared to\nstate-of-the-art baselines.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle with\ndomain-specific ones, requiring fine-tuning with specific data. With many\nopen-source LLMs available, selecting the best model for fine-tuning downstream\ntasks is challenging, primarily focusing on how to quickly identify the optimal\nLLM. We introduce a Data and Model Compression Framework (DaMoC) that addresses\nthis challenge by: 1) Data Level: A systematic categorization of data filtering\nmethodologies for LLMs is first established, classifying them into three\ndistinct paradigms: (1) distribution-aware methods, (2) quality-aware methods,\nand (3) hybrid approaches considering both dimensions. Further, we enhance the\ndensity of key tokens in the text achieving token compression. Subsequently, we\nuse an LLM to iterative rewrite the text to optimize its expression. 2) Model\nLevel: We use layer similarity scores to assess each layer's importance and\nremove those with lower importance. Then, we introduce a sparse merging\nparadigm to preserve as much of the original model's capability as possible.\nExtensive experiments on four datasets, medical Q&A, financial Q&A, general\nQ&A, and reading comprehension, show that we can select the optimal LLM while\nsaving approximately 20-fold in training time.",

Instead of relying\non fixed schemas or fine-tuned models, our method builds on internal\nrepresentations of large language models (LLMs) to embed both entity mentions\nand user-provided open-ended type descriptions into a shared semantic space. We\nshow that internal representations, specifically the value vectors from\nmid-layer transformer blocks, encode fine-grained type information more\neffectively than commonly used top-layer embeddings. To refine these\nrepresentations, we train a lightweight contrastive projection network that\naligns type-compatible entities while separating unrelated types.

To address this, we introduce Promptception, a systematic framework\nfor evaluating prompt sensitivity in LMMs. It consists of 61 prompt types,\nspanning 15 categories and 6 supercategories, each targeting specific aspects\nof prompt formulation, and is used to evaluate 10 LMMs ranging from lightweight\nopen-source models to GPT-4o and Gemini 1.5 Pro, across 3 MCQA benchmarks:\nMMStar, MMMU-Pro, MVBench.

    "summary": "With growing public safety demands, text-based person anomaly search has\nemerged as a critical task, aiming to retrieve individuals with abnormal\nbehaviors via natural language descriptions. Unlike conventional person search,\nthis task presents two unique challenges: (1) fine-grained cross-modal\nalignment between textual anomalies and visual behaviors, and (2) anomaly\nrecognition under sparse real-world samples. While Large Multi-modal Models\n(LMMs) excel in multi-modal understanding, their potential for fine-grained\nanomaly retrieval remains underexplored, hindered by: (1) a domain gap between\ngenerative knowledge and discriminative retrieval, and (2) the absence of\nefficient adaptation strategies for deployment. In this work, we propose\nAnomalyLMM, the first framework that harnesses LMMs for text-based person\nanomaly search. Our key contributions are: (1) A novel coarse-to-fine pipeline\nintegrating LMMs to bridge generative world knowledge with retrieval-centric\nanomaly detection; (2) A training-free adaptation cookbook featuring masked\ncross-modal prompting, behavioral saliency prediction, and knowledge-aware\nre-ranking, enabling zero-shot focus on subtle anomaly cues. As the first study\nto explore LMMs for this task, we conduct a rigorous evaluation on the PAB\ndataset, the only publicly available benchmark for text-based person anomaly\nsearch, with its curated real-world anomalies covering diverse scenarios (e.g.,\nfalling, collision, and being hit). Experiments show the effectiveness of the\nproposed method, surpassing the competitive baseline by +0.96% Recall@1\naccuracy. Notably, our method reveals interpretable alignment between textual\nanomalies and visual behaviors, validated via qualitative analysis. Our code\nand models will be released for future research.",

    "summary": "Grasping assistance is essential for restoring autonomy in individuals with\nmotor impairments, particularly in unstructured environments where object\ncategories and user intentions are diverse and unpredictable. We present\nOVGrasp, a hierarchical control framework for soft exoskeleton-based grasp\nassistance that integrates RGB-D vision, open-vocabulary prompts, and voice\ncommands to enable robust multimodal interaction. To enhance generalization in\nopen environments, OVGrasp incorporates a vision-language foundation model with\nan open-vocabulary mechanism, allowing zero-shot detection of previously unseen\nobjects without retraining. A multimodal decision-maker further fuses spatial\nand linguistic cues to infer user intent, such as grasp or release, in\nmulti-object scenarios. We deploy the complete framework on a custom\negocentric-view wearable exoskeleton and conduct systematic evaluations on 15\nobjects across three grasp types. Experimental results with ten participants\ndemonstrate that OVGrasp achieves a grasping ability score (GAS) of 87.00%,\noutperforming state-of-the-art baselines and achieving improved kinematic\nalignment with natural hand motion.",

    "summary": "Data augmentation is crucial for pixel-wise annotation tasks like semantic\nsegmentation, where labeling requires significant effort and intensive labor.\nTraditional methods, involving simple transformations such as rotations and\nflips, create new images but often lack diversity along key semantic dimensions\nand fail to alter high-level semantic properties. To address this issue,\ngenerative models have emerged as an effective solution for augmenting data by\ngenerating synthetic images. Controllable Generative models offer data\naugmentation methods for semantic segmentation tasks by using prompts and\nvisual references from the original image. However, these models face\nchallenges in generating synthetic images that accurately reflect the content\nand structure of the original image due to difficulties in creating effective\nprompts and visual references. In this work, we introduce an effective data\naugmentation pipeline for semantic segmentation using Controllable Diffusion\nmodel. Our proposed method includes efficient prompt generation using\nClass-Prompt Appending and Visual Prior Blending to enhance attention to\nlabeled classes in real images, allowing the pipeline to generate a precise\nnumber of augmented images while preserving the structure of\nsegmentation-labeled classes. In addition, we implement a class balancing\nalgorithm to ensure a balanced training dataset when merging the synthetic and\noriginal images. Evaluation on PASCAL VOC datasets, our pipeline demonstrates\nits effectiveness in generating high-quality synthetic images for semantic\nsegmentation.

    "summary": "As LLMs are increasingly applied in socially impactful settings, concerns\nabout gender bias have prompted growing efforts both to measure and mitigate\nsuch bias. These efforts often rely on evaluation tasks that differ from\nnatural language distributions, as they typically involve carefully constructed\ntask prompts that overtly or covertly signal the presence of gender\nbias-related content. In this paper, we examine how signaling the evaluative\npurpose of a task impacts measured gender bias in LLMs. Concretely, we test\nmodels under prompt conditions that (1) make the testing context salient, and\n(2) make gender-focused content salient. We then assess prompt sensitivity\nacross four task formats with both token-probability and discrete-choice\nmetrics. We find that even minor prompt changes can substantially alter bias\noutcomes, sometimes reversing their direction entirely. Discrete-choice metrics\nfurther tend to amplify bias relative to probabilistic measures. These findings\ndo not only highlight the brittleness of LLM gender bias evaluations but open a\nnew puzzle for the NLP benchmarking and development community: To what extent\ncan well-controlled testing designs trigger LLM ``testing mode'' performance,\nand what does this mean for the ecological validity of future benchmarks.",

We find that current large language models (LLMs), despite\nexcelling at many natural language processing (NLP) tasks, consistently fail to\ngrasp the layered semantics of Drivelological text. To investigate this, we\nconstruct a small but diverse benchmark dataset of over 1,200 meticulously\ncurated examples, with select instances in English, Mandarin, Spanish, French,\nJapanese, and Korean. Annotation was especially challenging: each of the\nexamples required careful expert review to verify that it truly reflected\nDrivelological characteristics. The process involved multiple rounds of\ndiscussion and adjudication to address disagreements, highlighting the subtle\nand subjective nature of the Drivelology. We evaluate a range of LLMs on\nclassification, generation, and reasoning tasks. Our results reveal clear\nlimitations of LLMs: models often confuse Drivelology with shallow nonsense,\nproduce incoherent justifications, or miss the implied rhetorical function\naltogether. These findings highlight a deeper representational gap in LLMs'\npragmatic understanding and challenge the assumption that statistical fluency\nimplies cognitive comprehension.

    "summary": "Recent advancements in robot navigation, particularly with end-to-end\nlearning approaches such as reinforcement learning (RL), have demonstrated\nstrong performance. However, successful navigation still depends on two key\ncapabilities: mapping and planning (explicitly or implicitly). Classical\napproaches rely on explicit mapping pipelines to register egocentric\nobservations into a coherent map. In contrast, end-to-end learning often\nachieves this implicitly -- through recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that fuse\ncurrent and historical observations into a latent space for planning. While\nexisting architectures, such as LSTM and GRU, can capture temporal\ndependencies, our findings reveal a critical limitation: their inability to\neffectively perform spatial memorization. This capability is essential for\nintegrating sequential observations from varying perspectives to build spatial\nrepresentations that support planning. To address this, we propose\nSpatially-Enhanced Recurrent Units (SRUs) -- a simple yet effective\nmodification to existing RNNs -- that enhance spatial memorization. We further\nintroduce an attention-based network architecture integrated with SRUs,\nenabling long-range mapless navigation using a single forward-facing stereo\ncamera. We also employ regularization techniques to facilitate robust\nend-to-end recurrent training via RL. Experimental results show 23.5% overall\nimprovement in long-range navigation compared to existing RNNs. With SRU\nmemory, our method outperforms RL baselines -- one relying on explicit mapping\nand the other on stacked historical observations -- by 29.6% and 105.0%,\nrespectively, across diverse environments requiring long-horizon mapping and\nmemorization. Finally, we address the sim-to-real gap by leveraging large-scale\npretraining on synthetic depth data, enabling zero-shot transfer for deployment\nacross diverse and complex real-world environments.",

    "summary": "While inference-time scaling enables LLMs to carry out increasingly long and\ncapable reasoning traces, the patterns and insights uncovered during these\ntraces are immediately discarded once the context window is reset for a new\nquery. External memory is a natural way to persist these discoveries, and\nrecent work has shown clear benefits for reasoning-intensive tasks. We see an\nopportunity to make such memories more broadly reusable and scalable by moving\nbeyond instance-based memory entries (e.g. exact query/response pairs, or\nsummaries tightly coupled with the original problem context) toward\nconcept-level memory: reusable, modular abstractions distilled from solution\ntraces and stored in natural language. For future queries, relevant concepts\nare selectively retrieved and integrated into the prompt, enabling test-time\ncontinual learning without weight updates. Our design introduces new strategies\nfor abstracting takeaways from rollouts and retrieving entries for new queries,\npromoting reuse and allowing memory to expand with additional experiences. On\nthe challenging ARC-AGI benchmark, our method yields a 7.5% relative gain over\na strong no-memory baseline with performance continuing to scale with inference\ncompute. We find abstract concepts to be the most consistent memory design,\noutscoring the baseline at all tested inference compute scales.

    "title": "Towards a Unified View of Large Language Model Post-Training",
    "summary": "Two major sources of training data exist for post-training modern language\nmodels: online (model-generated rollouts) data, and offline (human or\nother-model demonstrations) data. These two types of data are typically used by\napproaches like Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),\nrespectively. In this paper, we show that these approaches are not in\ncontradiction, but are instances of a single optimization process. We derive a\nUnified Policy Gradient Estimator, and present the calculations of a wide\nspectrum of post-training approaches as the gradient of a common objective\nunder different data distribution assumptions and various bias-variance\ntradeoffs. The gradient estimator is constructed with four interchangeable\nparts: stabilization mask, reference policy denominator, advantage estimate,\nand likelihood gradient. Motivated by our theoretical findings, we propose\nHybrid Post-Training (HPT), an algorithm that dynamically selects different\ntraining signals. HPT is designed to yield both effective exploitation of\ndemonstration and stable exploration without sacrificing learned reasoning\npatterns. We provide extensive experiments and ablation studies to verify the\neffectiveness of our unified theoretical framework and HPT. Across six\nmathematical reasoning benchmarks and two out-of-distribution suites, HPT\nconsistently surpasses strong baselines across models of varying scales and\nfamilies.",

    "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have been widely applied in speech\nand music. This tendency has led to a focus on audio tokenization for Large\nModels (LMs). Unlike semantic-only text tokens, audio tokens must both capture\nglobal semantic content and preserve fine-grained acoustic details. Moreover,\nthey provide a discrete method for speech and music that can be effectively\nintegrated into MLLMs. However, existing research is unsuitable in the\ndefinitions of semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. In addition, the evaluation\nof different codecs typically concentrates on specific domains or tasks, such\nas reconstruction or Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) task, which prevents\nfair and comprehensive comparisons. To address these problems, this paper\nprovides suitable definitions for semantic and acoustic tokens and introduces a\nsystematic evaluation framework. This framework allows for a comprehensive\nassessment of codecs' capabilities which evaluate across four dimensions: audio\nreconstruction metric, codebook index (ID) stability, decoder-only transformer\nperplexity, and performance on downstream probe tasks. Our results show the\ncorrectness of the provided suitable definitions and the correlation among\nreconstruction metrics, codebook ID stability, downstream probe tasks and\nperplexity.",

    "summary": "Although data visualization is powerful for revealing patterns and\ncommunicating insights, creating effective visualizations requires familiarity\nwith authoring tools and often disrupts the analysis flow. While large language\nmodels show promise for automatically converting analysis intent into\nvisualizations, existing methods function as black boxes without transparent\nreasoning processes, which prevents users from understanding design rationales\nand refining suboptimal outputs. To bridge this gap, we propose integrating\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into the Natural Language to Visualization\n(NL2VIS) pipeline. First, we design a comprehensive CoT reasoning process for\nNL2VIS and develop an automatic pipeline to equip existing datasets with\nstructured reasoning steps. Second, we introduce nvBench-CoT, a specialized\ndataset capturing detailed step-by-step reasoning from ambiguous natural\nlanguage descriptions to finalized visualizations, which enables\nstate-of-the-art performance when used for model fine-tuning. Third, we develop\nDeepVIS, an interactive visual interface that tightly integrates with the CoT\nreasoning process, allowing users to inspect reasoning steps, identify errors,\nand make targeted adjustments to improve visualization outcomes. Quantitative\nbenchmark evaluations, two use cases, and a user study collectively demonstrate\nthat our CoT framework effectively enhances NL2VIS quality while providing\ninsightful reasoning steps to users.",

    "summary": "Constraint Programming (CP) is widely used to solve combinatorial problems,\nbut its core process, namely constraint modelling, requires significant\nexpertise and is considered to be a bottleneck for wider adoption. Aiming to\nalleviate this bottleneck, recent studies have explored using Large Language\nModels (LLMs) to transform combinatorial problem descriptions into executable\nconstraint models. However, the existing evaluation datasets for constraint\nmodelling are often limited to small, homogeneous, or domain-specific\ninstances, which do not capture the diversity of real-world scenarios. This\nwork addresses this gap by introducing CP-Bench, a novel benchmark that\nincludes a diverse set of well-known combinatorial problems sourced from the CP\ncommunity, structured explicitly for evaluating LLM-driven CP modelling. With\nthis dataset, and given the variety of constraint modelling frameworks, we\ncompare and evaluate the modelling capabilities of LLMs for three distinct\nconstraint modelling systems, which vary in abstraction level and underlying\nsyntax. Notably, the results show higher performance when modelling with a\nhigh-level Python-based framework. Additionally, we systematically evaluate the\nuse of prompt-based and inference-time compute methods across different LLMs,\nwhich further increase accuracy, reaching up to 70% on this highly challenging\nbenchmark.",

    "summary": "Large language model (LLM) agents achieve impressive single-task performance\nbut commonly exhibit repeated failures, inefficient exploration, and limited\ncross-task adaptability. Existing reflective strategies (e.g., Reflexion,\nReAct) improve per-episode behavior but typically produce ephemeral,\ntask-specific traces that are not reused across tasks. Reinforcement-learning\nbased alternatives can produce transferable policies but require substantial\nparameter updates and compute. In this work we introduce Meta-Policy Reflexion\n(MPR): a hybrid framework that consolidates LLM-generated reflections into a\nstructured, predicate-like Meta-Policy Memory (MPM) and applies that memory at\ninference time through two complementary mechanisms soft memory-guided decoding\nand hard rule admissibility checks(HAC). MPR (i) externalizes reusable\ncorrective knowledge without model weight updates, (ii) enforces domain\nconstraints to reduce unsafe or invalid actions, and (iii) retains the\nadaptability of language-based reflection. We formalize the MPM representation,\npresent algorithms for update and decoding, and validate the approach in a\ntext-based agent environment following the experimental protocol described in\nthe provided implementation (AlfWorld-based). Empirical results reported in the\nsupplied material indicate consistent gains in execution accuracy and\nrobustness when compared to Reflexion baselines; rule admissibility further\nimproves stability. We analyze mechanisms that explain these gains, discuss\nscalability and failure modes, and outline future directions for multimodal and\nmulti?agent extensions.",

However, existing methods use either multi-round\ntraining or knowledge within minibatches, posing challenges in finding a\nfavorable coupling strategy for straightening trajectories to few-step\ngeneration. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, Straighter\ntrajectories of Flow Matching (StraightFM). It straightens trajectories with\nthe coupling strategy from the entire distribution level. More specifically,\nduring training, StraightFM creates couplings of images and noise via one\ndiffusion model as a coupling prior to straighten trajectories for few-step\ngeneration. Our coupling strategy can also integrate with the existing coupling\ndirection from real data to noise, improving image quality in few-step\ngeneration. Experimental results on pixel space and latent space show that\nStraightFM yields attractive samples within 5 steps. Moreover, our\nunconditional StraightFM is seamlessly compatible with training-free multimodal\nconditional generation, maintaining high-quality image generation in few steps.",

    "summary": "The proliferation of Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) has significantly\nadvanced zero-shot forecasting, enabling predictions for unseen time series\nwithout task-specific fine-tuning. Extensive research has confirmed that no\nsingle TSFM excels universally, as different models exhibit preferences for\ndistinct temporal patterns. This diversity suggests an opportunity: how to take\nadvantage of the complementary abilities of TSFMs. To this end, we propose\nZooCast, which characterizes each model's distinct forecasting strengths.\nZooCast can intelligently assemble current TSFMs into a model zoo that\ndynamically selects optimal models for different forecasting tasks. Our key\ninnovation lies in the One-Embedding-Fits-All paradigm that constructs a\nunified representation space where each model in the zoo is represented by a\nsingle embedding, enabling efficient similarity matching for all tasks.\nExperiments demonstrate ZooCast's strong performance on the GIFT-Eval zero-shot\nforecasting benchmark while maintaining the efficiency of a single TSFM.

    "summary": "The widespread adoption of Kubernetes (K8s) for orchestrating cloud-native\napplications has introduced significant security challenges, such as\nmisconfigured resources and overly permissive configurations. Failing to\naddress these issues can result in unauthorized access, privilege escalation,\nand lateral movement within clusters. Most existing K8s security solutions\nfocus on detecting misconfigurations, typically through static analysis or\nanomaly detection. In contrast, this paper presents KubeGuard, a novel runtime\nlog-driven recommender framework aimed at mitigating risks by addressing overly\npermissive configurations. KubeGuard is designed to harden K8s environments\nthrough two complementary tasks: Resource Creation and Resource Refinement. It\nleverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze manifests and runtime logs\nreflecting actual system behavior, using modular prompt-chaining workflows.\nThis approach enables KubeGuard to create least-privilege configurations for\nnew resources and refine existing manifests to reduce the attack surface.\nKubeGuard's output manifests are presented as recommendations that users (e.g.,\ndevelopers and operators) can review and adopt to enhance cluster security. Our\nevaluation demonstrates that KubeGuard effectively generates and refines K8s\nmanifests for Roles, NetworkPolicies, and Deployments, leveraging both\nproprietary and open-source LLMs. The high precision, recall, and F1-scores\naffirm KubeGuard's practicality as a framework that translates runtime\nobservability into actionable, least-privilege configuration guidance.",

    "summary": "Systemic Functional Grammar and its branch, Cardiff Grammar, have been widely\napplied to discourse analysis, semantic function research, and other tasks\nacross various languages and texts. However, an automatic annotation system\nbased on this theory for Chinese texts has not yet been developed, which\nsignificantly constrains the application and promotion of relevant theories. To\nfill this gap, this research introduces a functional syntax annotation model\nfor Chinese based on RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach).\nThe study randomly selected 4,100 sentences from the People's Daily 2014 corpus\nand annotated them according to functional syntax theory to establish a dataset\nfor training. The study then fine-tuned the RoBERTa-Chinese wwm-ext model based\non the dataset to implement the named entity recognition task, achieving an F1\nscore of 0.852 on the test set that significantly outperforms other comparative\nmodels. The model demonstrated excellent performance in identifying core\nsyntactic elements such as Subject (S), Main Verb (M), and Complement (C).\nNevertheless, there remains room for improvement in recognizing entities with\nimbalanced label samples. As the first integration of functional syntax with\nattention-based NLP models, this research provides a new method for automated\nChinese functional syntax analysis and lays a solid foundation for subsequent\nstudies.",

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been explored as powerful text\nembedders. Existing LLM-based text embedding approaches often leverage the\nembedding of the final token, typically a reserved special token such as [EOS].\nHowever, these tokens have not been intentionally trained to capture the\nsemantics of the whole context, limiting their capacity as text embeddings,\nespecially for retrieval and re-ranking tasks. We propose to add a new training\nstage before contrastive learning to enrich the semantics of the final token\nembedding. This stage employs bidirectional generative reconstruction tasks,\nnamely EBQ2D (Embedding-Based Query-to-Document) and EBD2Q (Embedding-Based\nDocument-to-Query), which interleave to anchor the [EOS] embedding and\nreconstruct either side of Query-Document pairs. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our additional training stage significantly improves LLM\nperformance on the Massive Text Embedding Benchmark (MTEB), achieving new\nstate-of-the-art results across different LLM base models and scales.",

    "summary": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized\nnatural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in\nunderstanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,\nparticularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively\nenhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,\nwhere models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.\nExisting solutions either require access to general instruction data or face\nlimitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these\nlimitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that\naligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,\nthereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream\nperformance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior\nbalance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our\ncomprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between\ndistribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG\nscenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general\ninstruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.\nOur findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in\nRAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse\nfine-tuning scenarios.

    "summary": "Complex Question Answering (QA) is a fundamental and challenging task in NLP.\nWhile large language models (LLMs) exhibit impressive performance in QA, they\nsuffer from significant performance degradation when facing complex and\nabstract QA tasks due to insufficient reasoning capabilities. Works such as\nChain-of-Thought (CoT) and Tree-of-Thought (ToT) aim to enhance LLMs' reasoning\nabilities, but they face issues such as in-layer redundancy in tree structures\nand single paths in chain structures. Although some studies utilize\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods to assist LLMs in reasoning, the\nchallenge of effectively utilizing large amounts of information involving\nmultiple entities and hops remains critical. To address this, we propose the\nMatrix of Thought (MoT), a novel and efficient LLM thought structure. MoT\nexplores the problem in both horizontal and vertical dimensions through the\n\"column-cell communication\" mechanism, enabling LLMs to actively engage in\nmulti-strategy and deep-level thinking, reducing redundancy within the column\ncells and enhancing reasoning capabilities. Furthermore, we develop a\nfact-correction mechanism by constructing knowledge units from retrieved\nknowledge graph triples and raw text to enhance the initial knowledge for LLM\nreasoning and correct erroneous answers. This leads to the development of an\nefficient and accurate QA framework (MTQA). Experimental results show that our\nframework outperforms state-of-the-art methods on four widely-used datasets in\nterms of F1 and EM scores, with reasoning time only 14.4\\% of the baseline\nmethods, demonstrating both its efficiency and accuracy.

    "summary": "Publishing a large language model (LLM) benchmark on the Internet risks\ncontaminating future LLMs: the benchmark may be unintentionally (or\nintentionally) used to train or select a model. A common mitigation is to keep\nthe benchmark private and let participants submit their models or predictions\nto the organizers. However, this strategy will require trust in a single\norganization and still permits test-set overfitting through repeated queries.\nTo overcome this issue, we propose a way to publish benchmarks without\ncompletely disclosing the ground-truth answers to the questions, while still\nmaintaining the ability to openly evaluate LLMs. Our main idea is to inject\nrandomness to the answers by preparing several logically correct answers, and\nonly include one of them as the solution in the benchmark. This reduces the\nbest possible accuracy, i.e., Bayes accuracy, of the benchmark. Not only is\nthis helpful to keep us from disclosing the ground truth, but this approach\nalso offers a test for detecting data contamination. In principle, even fully\ncapable models should not surpass the Bayes accuracy. If a model surpasses this\nceiling despite this expectation, this is a strong signal of data\ncontamination. We present experimental evidence that our method can detect data\ncontamination accurately on a wide range of benchmarks, models, and training\nmethodologies.",

We\nvalidate our approach through three case studies demonstrating how INGRID\nassists users in designing task-specific parallel robots based on desired\nmobility requirements. By bridging the gap between mechanism theory and machine\nlearning, INGRID enables researchers without specialized robotics training to\ncreate custom parallel mechanisms, thereby decoupling advances in robotic\nintelligence from hardware constraints.

Simulated AI\nbias approximates factual and counterfactual estimates of racial bias in\nreal-world AI systems. We investigate people's preferences for White, Black,\nHispanic, and Asian candidates (represented through names and affinity groups\non quality-controlled resumes) across 1,526 scenarios and measure their\nunconscious associations between race and status using implicit association\ntests (IATs), which predict discriminatory hiring decisions but have not been\ninvestigated in human-AI collaboration. When making decisions without AI or\nwith AI that exhibits no race-based preferences, people select all candidates\nat equal rates. However, when interacting with AI favoring a particular group,\npeople also favor those candidates up to 90% of the time, indicating a\nsignificant behavioral shift. The likelihood of selecting candidates whose\nidentities do not align with common race-status stereotypes can increase by 13%\nif people complete an IAT before conducting resume screening. Finally, even if\npeople think AI recommendations are low quality or not important, their\ndecisions are still vulnerable to AI bias under certain circumstances. This\nwork has implications for people's autonomy in AI-HITL scenarios, AI and work,\ndesign and evaluation of AI hiring systems, and strategies for mitigating bias\nin collaborative decision-making tasks. In particular, organizational and\nregulatory policy should acknowledge the complex nature of AI-HITL decision\nmaking when implementing these systems, educating people who use them, and\ndetermining which are subject to oversight.",

Upgraded on vanilla iTransformer, SST-iTransformer integrates\nmasking-reconstruction-based pretext tasks for self-supervised spatio-temporal\nrepresentation learning, and features an innovative dual-branch attention\nmechanism: Series Attention captures long-term temporal dependencies via\npatching operations, while Channel Attention models cross-variate interactions\nthrough inverted dimensions. Extensive experiments using real-world data from\nChengdu, China, demonstrate that SST-iTransformer outperforms baseline deep\nlearning models (including Informer, Autoformer, Crossformer, and\niTransformer), achieving state-of-the-art performance with the lowest mean\nsquared error (MSE) and competitive mean absolute error (MAE). Comprehensive\nablation studies quantitatively reveal the relative importance of different\ndata sources: incorporating ride-hailing data provides the largest performance\ngains, followed by taxi, whereas fixed-route transit features (bus/metro)\ncontribute marginally. Spatial correlation analysis further confirms that\nexcluding historical data from correlated parking lots within PCZs leads to\nsubstantial performance degradation, underscoring the importance of modeling\nspatial dependencies.",

    "summary": "Data augmentation is a critical technique in deep learning. Traditional\nmethods like Back-translation typically focus on lexical-level rephrasing,\nwhich primarily produces variations with the same semantics. While large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have enhanced text augmentation by their \"knowledge\nemergence\" capability, controlling the style and structure of these outputs\nremains challenging and requires meticulous prompt engineering. In this paper,\nwe propose LMTransplant, a novel text augmentation paradigm leveraging LLMs.\nThe core idea of LMTransplant is transplant-then-regenerate: incorporating seed\ntext into a context expanded by LLM, and asking the LLM to regenerate a variant\nbased on the expanded context. This strategy allows the model to create more\ndiverse and creative content-level variants by fully leveraging the knowledge\nembedded in LLMs, while preserving the core attributes of the original text. We\nevaluate LMTransplant across various text-related tasks, demonstrating its\nsuperior performance over existing text augmentation methods. Moreover,\nLMTransplant demonstrates exceptional scalability as the size of augmented data\ngrows.",

    "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a\npowerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language\nmodels, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions:\nDepth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances\nconsumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and\nreveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights\nsamples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances\nthat are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth\nneglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which\nre-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby\nincreasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically,\nnaively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts\nPass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra\ninference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of\nexploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training\ndata can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch\nsize and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over\nmultiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance.\nLarge-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued\nexploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which\naugments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K\nand Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across\ndepth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the\nreasoning power of RLVR.",

    "summary": "3D visual grounding allows an embodied agent to understand visual information\nin real-world 3D environments based on human instructions, which is crucial for\nembodied intelligence. Existing 3D visual grounding methods typically rely on\nseparate encoders for different modalities (e.g., RGB images, text, and 3D\npoint clouds), resulting in large and complex models that are inefficient to\ntrain. While some approaches use pre-trained 2D multi-modal models like CLIP\nfor 3D tasks, they still struggle with aligning point cloud data to 2D\nencoders. As a result, these methods continue to depend on 3D encoders for\nfeature extraction, further increasing model complexity and training\ninefficiency. In this paper, we propose a unified 2D pre-trained multi-modal\nnetwork to process all three modalities (RGB images, text, and point clouds),\nsignificantly simplifying the architecture. By leveraging a 2D CLIP bi-modal\nmodel with adapter-based fine-tuning, this framework effectively adapts to the\ntri-modal setting, improving both adaptability and performance across\nmodalities. Our Geometric-Aware 2D-3D Feature Recovery and Fusion (GARF) module\nis designed to fuse geometric multi-scale features from point clouds and\nimages. We then integrate textual features for final modality fusion and\nintroduce a multi-modal decoder to facilitate deep cross-modal understanding.\nTogether, our method achieves unified feature extraction and fusion across the\nthree modalities, enabling an end-to-end 3D visual grounding model. Compared to\nthe baseline, our method reduces the number of trainable parameters by\napproximately 58\\%, while achieving a 6.52\\% improvement in the 3D detection\ntask and a 6.25\\% improvement in the 3D visual grounding task.",

However, their training involves distinguishing real data\nfrom synthetically generated data using adversarial discriminators, which can\nlead to unstable training dynamics and mode dropping issues. In this work, we\nbuild on the \\textit{invariant statistical loss} (ISL) method introduced in\n\\cite{de2024training}, and extend it to handle heavy-tailed and multivariate\ndata distributions.\n  The data generated by many real-world phenomena can only be properly\ncharacterised using heavy-tailed probability distributions, and traditional\nimplicit methods struggle to effectively capture their asymptotic behavior. To\naddress this problem, we introduce a generator trained with ISL, that uses\ninput noise from a generalised Pareto distribution (GPD). We refer to this\ngenerative scheme as Pareto-ISL for conciseness. Our experiments demonstrate\nthat Pareto-ISL accurately models the tails of the distributions while still\neffectively capturing their central characteristics.\n  The original ISL function was conceived for 1D data sets. When the actual\ndata is $n$-dimensional, a straightforward extension of the method was obtained\nby targeting the $n$ marginal distributions of the data. This approach is\ncomputationally infeasible and ineffective in high-dimensional spaces. To\novercome this, we extend the 1D approach using random projections and define a\nnew loss function suited for multivariate data, keeping problems tractable by\nadjusting the number of projections.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) typically deploy safety mechanisms to prevent\nharmful content generation. Most current approaches focus narrowly on risks\nposed by malicious actors, often framing risks as adversarial events and\nrelying on defensive refusals. However, in real-world settings, risks also come\nfrom non-malicious users seeking help while under psychological distress (e.g.,\nself-harm intentions). In such cases, the model's response can strongly\ninfluence the user's next actions. Simple refusals may lead them to repeat,\nescalate, or move to unsafe platforms, creating worse outcomes. We introduce\nConstructive Safety Alignment (CSA), a human-centric paradigm that protects\nagainst malicious misuse while actively guiding vulnerable users toward safe\nand helpful results. Implemented in Oyster-I (Oy1), CSA combines game-theoretic\nanticipation of user reactions, fine-grained risk boundary discovery, and\ninterpretable reasoning control, turning safety into a trust-building process.\nOy1 achieves state-of-the-art safety among open models while retaining high\ngeneral capabilities. On our Constructive Benchmark, it shows strong\nconstructive engagement, close to GPT-5, and unmatched robustness on the\nStrata-Sword jailbreak dataset, nearing GPT-o1 levels. By shifting from\nrefusal-first to guidance-first safety, CSA redefines the model-user\nrelationship, aiming for systems that are not just safe, but meaningfully\nhelpful. We release Oy1, code, and the benchmark to support responsible,\nuser-centered AI.",

We demonstrate that our framework achieves\nconsistently high performance across sequence-only (ESM-2, ESMc),\ndual-decodable (CHEAP), and multimodal (SaProt) representations using the same\narchitecture and training approach. We extensively evaluate existing methods\nalongside DiMA using multiple metrics across two protein modalities, covering\nquality, diversity, novelty, and distribution matching of generated proteins.\nDiMA consistently produces novel, high-quality and diverse protein sequences\nand achieves strong results compared to baselines such as autoregressive,\ndiscrete diffusion and flow matching language models. The model demonstrates\nversatile functionality, supporting conditional generation tasks including\nprotein family-generation, motif scaffolding and infilling, and fold-specific\nsequence design.

    "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) effectiveness is usually evaluated by means of\nbenchmarks such as MMLU, ARC-C, or HellaSwag, where questions are presented in\ntheir original wording, thus in a fixed, standardized format. However,\nreal-world applications involve linguistic variability, requiring models to\nmaintain their effectiveness across diverse rewordings of the same question or\nquery. In this study, we systematically assess the robustness of LLMs to\nparaphrased benchmark questions and investigate whether benchmark-based\nevaluations provide a reliable measure of model capabilities. We systematically\ngenerate various paraphrases of all the questions across six different common\nbenchmarks, and measure the resulting variations in effectiveness of 34\nstate-of-the-art LLMs, of different size and effectiveness. Our findings reveal\nthat while LLM rankings remain relatively stable across paraphrased inputs,\nabsolute effectiveness scores change, and decline significantly. This suggests\nthat LLMs struggle with linguistic variability, raising concerns about their\ngeneralization abilities and evaluation methodologies. Furthermore, the\nobserved performance drop challenges the reliability of benchmark-based\nevaluations, indicating that high benchmark scores may not fully capture a\nmodel's robustness to real-world input variations. We discuss the implications\nof these findings for LLM evaluation methodologies, emphasizing the need for\nrobustness-aware benchmarks that better reflect practical deployment scenarios.",

This conflict between generation steps and output quality arises from\nrestrictive training objectives that focus exclusively on either infinitesimal\ndynamics (PF-ODEs) or direct endpoint prediction. We address this challenge by\nintroducing an exact, continuous-time dynamics equation that analytically\ndefines state transitions across any finite time interval. This leads to a\nnovel generative paradigm, Transition Models (TiM), which adapt to\narbitrary-step transitions, seamlessly traversing the generative trajectory\nfrom single leaps to fine-grained refinement with more steps. Despite having\nonly 865M parameters, TiM achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing\nleading models such as SD3.5 (8B parameters) and FLUX.1 (12B parameters) across\nall evaluated step counts. Importantly, unlike previous few-step generators,\nTiM demonstrates monotonic quality improvement as the sampling budget\nincreases.

    "summary": "Tabular data sets with varying missing values are prepared for machine\nlearning using an arbitrary imputation strategy. Synthetic values generated by\nimputation models often raise concerns about data quality and the reliability\nof data-driven outcomes. To address these concerns, this article proposes an\nimputation-free incremental attention learning (IFIAL) method for tabular data.\nA pair of attention masks is derived and retrofitted to a transformer to\ndirectly streamline tabular data without imputing or initializing missing\nvalues. The proposed method incrementally learns partitions of overlapping and\nfixed-size feature sets to enhance the efficiency and performance of the\ntransformer. The average classification performance rank order across 17\ndiverse tabular data sets highlights the superiority of IFIAL over 11\nstate-of-the-art learning methods with or without missing value imputations.\nFurther experiments substantiate the robustness of IFIAL against varying\nmissing value types and rates compared to methods involving missing value\nimputation. Our analysis reveals that a feature partition size of half the\noriginal feature space is, both computationally and in terms of accuracy, the\nbest choice for the proposed incremental learning. The proposed method is one\nof the first solutions to enable deep attention learning of tabular data\nwithout requiring missing-value imputation. The source code for this paper is\npublicly available.",

    "summary": "Long-range dependency is one of the most desired properties of recent\nsequence models such as state-space models (particularly Mamba) and transformer\nmodels. New model architectures are being actively developed and benchmarked\nfor prediction tasks requiring long-range dependency. However, the capability\nof modeling long-range dependencies of these models has not been investigated\nfrom a theoretical perspective, which hinders a systematic improvement on this\naspect. In this work, we mathematically define long-range dependency using the\nderivative of hidden states with respect to past inputs and compare the\ncapability of SSM and transformer models of modeling long-range dependency\nbased on this definition. We showed that the long-range dependency of SSM\ndecays exponentially with the sequence length, which aligns with the\nexponential decay of memory function in RNN. But the attention mechanism used\nin transformers is more flexible and is not constrained to exponential decay,\nwhich could in theory perform better at modeling long-range dependency with\nsufficient training data, computing resources, and proper training. To combine\nthe flexibility of long-range dependency of attention mechanism and computation\nefficiency of SSM, we propose a new formulation for hidden state update in SSM\nand prove its stability under a standard Gaussian distribution of the input\ndata.",

While classical approaches\nsuch as Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) remain widely used, they often fail\nto capture the spatial dependencies inherent in energy networks. Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) offer a principled framework to incorporate this structure by\ndirectly leveraging graph topologies. In this work, we evaluate a broad set of\nGNN architectures -- including GCN, GraphSAGE, ChebConv, TAG, APPNP,\nTransformerConv, and Graph Attention Networks (GAT and GATv2) -- on two\nreal-world electricity consumption datasets from France and the UK. Our results\nshow that simpler models such as GCN, SAGE, or APPNP often outperform more\ncomplex alternatives in low-data regimes, while GAT ranks among the strongest\narchitectures in our benchmarks, combining high accuracy with valuable\ninterpretability. We perform a temporal analysis of attention weights,\nrevealing evolving patterns of regional interaction linked to seasonal and\nmeteorological variability. These results highlight that, although attention is\nnot universally superior, it provides valuable explanatory power when spatial\ndependencies are prominent. Additionally, we demonstrate that ensemble-based\nexpert aggregation strategies, particularly bottom-up combinations,\nsignificantly improve robustness and yield state-of-the-art performance across\nboth datasets.

In such settings, traditional positioning techniques\nrelying on line-of-sight (LoS) or cooperative signaling fail due to severe\nmultipath propagation and unknown transmit power. This paper proposes a novel\ngenerative inference framework for NLoS localization based on conditional\ndiffusion models. By leveraging the physical insight that diffracted\nelectromagnetic energy concentrates near building edges, we develop a sampling\nstrategy that collects sparse received signal strength (RSS) measurements at\nthe geometric vertices of obstacles--locations that maximize Fisher information\nand mutual information with respect to the unknown source. To overcome the lack\nof known transmission power, we normalize all sampled RSS values relative to\nthe maximum observed intensity, enabling the construction of a power-invariant\nradio map (RM). A conditional diffusion model is trained to reconstruct the\nfull RM based on environmental layout and sparse RSS observations. Localization\nis then achieved by identifying the brightest point on the generated RM.\nMoreover, the proposed framework is compatible with existing RSS-based\nlocalization algorithms, enabling a dual-driven paradigm that fuses physical\nknowledge and data-driven inference for improved accuracy.

    "summary": "Traffic accident prediction and detection are critical for enhancing road\nsafety, and vision-based traffic accident anticipation (Vision-TAA) has emerged\nas a promising approach in the era of deep learning. This paper reviews 147\nrecent studies, focusing on the application of supervised, unsupervised, and\nhybrid deep learning models for accident prediction, alongside the use of\nreal-world and synthetic datasets. Current methodologies are categorized into\nfour key approaches: image and video feature-based prediction, spatio-temporal\nfeature-based prediction, scene understanding, and multi modal data fusion.\nWhile these methods demonstrate significant potential, challenges such as data\nscarcity, limited generalization to complex scenarios, and real-time\nperformance constraints remain prevalent. This review highlights opportunities\nfor future research, including the integration of multi modal data fusion,\nself-supervised learning, and Transformer-based architectures to enhance\nprediction accuracy and scalability. By synthesizing existing advancements and\nidentifying critical gaps, this paper provides a foundational reference for\ndeveloping robust and adaptive Vision-TAA systems, contributing to road safety\nand traffic management.",

    "summary": "Driven by autonomous driving's demands for precise 3D perception, 3D semantic\noccupancy prediction has become a pivotal research topic. Unlike\nbird's-eye-view (BEV) methods, which restrict scene representation to a 2D\nplane, occupancy prediction leverages a complete 3D voxel grid to model spatial\nstructures in all dimensions, thereby capturing semantic variations along the\nvertical axis. However, most existing approaches overlook height-axis\ninformation when processing voxel features. And conventional SENet-style\nchannel attention assigns uniform weight across all height layers, limiting\ntheir ability to emphasize features at different heights. To address these\nlimitations, we propose SliceSemOcc, a novel vertical slice based multimodal\nframework for 3D semantic occupancy representation. Specifically, we extract\nvoxel features along the height-axis using both global and local vertical\nslices. Then, a global local fusion module adaptively reconciles fine-grained\nspatial details with holistic contextual information. Furthermore, we propose\nthe SEAttention3D module, which preserves height-wise resolution through\naverage pooling and assigns dynamic channel attention weights to each height\nlayer. Extensive experiments on nuScenes-SurroundOcc and nuScenes-OpenOccupancy\ndatasets verify that our method significantly enhances mean IoU, achieving\nespecially pronounced gains on most small-object categories. Detailed ablation\nstudies further validate the effectiveness of the proposed SliceSemOcc\nframework.",

In this\npaper, we propose a dual-stream neural framework designed to generate\nsynchronized hand gestures for piano playing from audio input, addressing the\ncritical challenge of modeling both hand independence and coordination. Our\nframework introduces two key innovations: (i) a decoupled diffusion-based\ngeneration framework that independently models each hand's motion via\ndual-noise initialization, sampling distinct latent noise for each while\nleveraging a shared positional condition, and (ii) a Hand-Coordinated\nAsymmetric Attention (HCAA) mechanism suppresses symmetric (common-mode) noise\nto highlight asymmetric hand-specific features, while adaptively enhancing\ninter-hand coordination during denoising.

    "summary": "Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new\nparadigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character\nRecognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,\ngenerative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to\nhallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.\nFurthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less\neffective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on\ndomain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a\nreasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through\ntraining reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,\nour DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its\nown OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to\nobtain their results as references, finally \"looks again\" the image and\nrethinks about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content.\nSince architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which\nmakes them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate\nhallucinations. We evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and\nexperimental results show that our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently\noutperform their non-reasoning counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves\nthe effectiveness of our method. Additionally, the results indicate that\nenhancing expert models, which are typically small and easy to iterate, enable\nperformance improvements for VLMs.",

    "summary": "The advent of foundation models (FMs) is transforming medical domain. In\nophthalmology, RETFound, a retina-specific FM pre-trained sequentially on 1.4\nmillion natural images and 1.6 million retinal images, has demonstrated high\nadaptability across clinical applications. Conversely, DINOv2, a\ngeneral-purpose vision FM pre-trained on 142 million natural images, has shown\npromise in non-medical domains. However, its applicability to clinical tasks\nremains underexplored. To address this, we conducted head-to-head evaluations\nby fine-tuning RETFound and three DINOv2 models (large, base, small) for ocular\ndisease detection and systemic disease prediction tasks, across eight\nstandardized open-source ocular datasets, as well as the Moorfields AlzEye and\nthe UK Biobank datasets. DINOv2-large model outperformed RETFound in detecting\ndiabetic retinopathy (AUROC=0.850-0.952 vs 0.823-0.944, across three datasets,\nall P<=0.007) and multi-class eye diseases (AUROC=0.892 vs. 0.846, P<0.001). In\nglaucoma, DINOv2-base model outperformed RETFound (AUROC=0.958 vs 0.940,\nP<0.001). Conversely, RETFound achieved superior performance over all DINOv2\nmodels in predicting heart failure, myocardial infarction, and ischaemic stroke\n(AUROC=0.732-0.796 vs 0.663-0.771, all P<0.001). These trends persisted even\nwith 10% of the fine-tuning data. These findings showcase the distinct\nscenarios where general-purpose and domain-specific FMs excel, highlighting the\nimportance of aligning FM selection with task-specific requirements to optimise\nclinical performance.",

    "summary": "Large language model-based chatbots have enhanced engagement in financial\nnegotiations, but their overreliance on passive empathy introduces critical\nrisks in credit collection. While empathy-driven approaches preserve client\nsatisfaction in benign cases, they fail catastrophically against dishonest\ndebtors--individuals who exploit conciliatory tactics to manipulate terms or\nevade repayment. Blindly prioritizing \"customer experience\" in such scenarios\nleads to creditor vulnerabilities: revenue leakage, moral hazard, and systemic\nexploitation. To address this, we propose EQ-Knight, an LLM agent that\ndynamically optimizes emotional strategy to defend creditor interests. Unlike\nnaive empathy-centric bots, EQ-Knight integrates emotion memory and\ngame-theoretic reasoning, powered by a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to track and\npredict debtor emotional states. By analyzing both real-time and historical\nemotional cues, EQ-Knight strategically counters negative emotions (e.g.,\naggression, feigned distress) while preserving productive debtor relationships.\nExperiments demonstrate EQ-Knight's superiority over conventional LLM\nnegotiators: it achieves a 32\\% reduction in concession losses without\ncompromising recovery rates, particularly in adversarial cases where debtors\nweaponize negative emotions (e.g., intimidation, guilt-tripping) to coerce\nconcessions. For credit agencies, EQ-Knight transforms LLMs from high-risk\n\"people-pleasers\" into strategic emotion-defenders--balancing emotional\nintelligence with tactical rigor to enforce accountability and deter\nexploitation.",

    "summary": "Text-to-speech (TTS) systems have recently achieved more expressive and\nnatural speech synthesis by scaling to large speech datasets. However, the\nproportion of expressive speech in such large-scale corpora is often unclear.\nBesides, existing expressive speech corpora are typically smaller in scale and\nprimarily used for benchmarking TTS systems. In this paper, we introduce the\nLibriQuote dataset, an English corpus derived from read audiobooks, designed\nfor both fine-tuning and benchmarking expressive zero-shot TTS system. The\ntraining dataset includes 12.7K hours of read, non-expressive speech and 5.3K\nhours of mostly expressive speech drawn from character quotations. Each\nutterance in the expressive subset is supplemented with the context in which it\nwas written, along with pseudo-labels of speech verbs and adverbs used to\ndescribe the quotation (\\textit{e.g. ``he whispered softly''}). Additionally,\nwe provide a challenging 7.5 hour test set intended for benchmarking TTS\nsystems: given a neutral reference speech as input, we evaluate system's\nability to synthesize an expressive utterance while preserving reference\ntimbre. We validate qualitatively the test set by showing that it covers a wide\nrange of emotions compared to non-expressive speech, along with various\naccents. Extensive subjective and objective evaluations show that fine-tuning a\nbaseline TTS system on LibriQuote significantly improves its synthesized speech\nintelligibility, and that recent systems fail to synthesize speech as\nexpressive and natural as the ground-truth utterances.

    "title": "Mitigating Bias in Text Classification via Prompt-Based Text   Transformation",
    "summary": "The presence of specific linguistic signals particular to a certain sub-group\ncan become highly salient to language models during training. In automated\ndecision-making settings, this may lead to biased outcomes when models rely on\ncues that correlate with protected characteristics. We investigate whether\nprompting ChatGPT to rewrite text using simplification, neutralisation,\nlocalisation, and formalisation can reduce demographic signals while preserving\nmeaning. Experimental results show a statistically significant drop in location\nclassification accuracy across multiple models after transformation, suggesting\nreduced reliance on group-specific language. At the same time, sentiment\nanalysis and rating prediction tasks confirm that the core meaning of the\nreviews remains greatly intact. These results suggest that prompt-based\nrewriting offers a practical and generalisable approach for mitigating bias in\ntext classification.",

This section\nserves as a valuable resource for early-career researchers seeking unexplored\nareas and experienced researchers looking for new projects or collaborations.\nIn this study, we generate future work suggestions from a scientific article.\nTo enrich the generation process with broader insights and reduce the chance of\nmissing important research directions, we use context from related papers using\nRAG. We experimented with various Large Language Models (LLMs) integrated into\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). We incorporate an LLM feedback mechanism\nto enhance the quality of the generated content and introduce an LLM-as-a-judge\nframework for robust evaluation, assessing key aspects such as novelty,\nhallucination, and feasibility. Our results demonstrate that the RAG-based\napproach using GPT-4o mini, combined with an LLM feedback mechanism,\noutperforms other methods based on both qualitative and quantitative\nevaluations. Moreover, we conduct a human evaluation to assess the LLM as an\nextractor, generator, and feedback provider.",

    "summary": "Short-video platforms have gained immense popularity, captivating the\ninterest of millions, if not billions, of users globally. Recently, researchers\nhave highlighted the significance of analyzing the propagation of short-videos,\nwhich typically involves discovering commercial values, public opinions, user\nbehaviors, etc. This paper proposes a new Short-video Propagation Influence\nRating (SPIR) task and aims to promote SPIR from both the dataset and method\nperspectives. First, we propose a new Cross-platform Short-Video (XS-Video)\ndataset, which aims to provide a large-scale and real-world short-video\npropagation network across various platforms to facilitate the research on\nshort-video propagation. Our XS-Video dataset includes 117,720 videos, 381,926\nsamples, and 535 topics across 5 biggest Chinese platforms, annotated with the\npropagation influence from level 0 to 9. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first large-scale short-video dataset that contains cross-platform data or\nprovides all of the views, likes, shares, collects, fans, comments, and comment\ncontent. Second, we propose a Large Graph Model (LGM) named NetGPT, based on a\nnovel three-stage training mechanism, to bridge heterogeneous graph-structured\ndata with the powerful reasoning ability and knowledge of Large Language Models\n(LLMs). Our NetGPT can comprehend and analyze the short-video propagation\ngraph, enabling it to predict the long-term propagation influence of\nshort-videos. Comprehensive experimental results evaluated by both\nclassification and regression metrics on our XS-Video dataset indicate the\nsuperiority of our method for SPIR.",

    "summary": "The use of large language models (LLMs) as judges, particularly in preference\ncomparisons, has become widespread, but this reveals a notable bias towards\nlonger responses, undermining the reliability of such evaluations. To better\nunderstand such bias, we propose to decompose the preference evaluation metric,\nspecifically the win rate, into two key components: desirability and\ninformation mass, where the former is length-independent and related to\ntrustworthiness such as correctness, toxicity, and consistency, and the latter\nis length-dependent and represents the amount of information in the response.\nWe empirically demonstrated the decomposition through controlled experiments\nand found that response length impacts evaluations by influencing information\nmass. To derive a reliable evaluation metric that assesses content quality\nwithout being confounded by response length, we propose AdapAlpaca, a simple\nyet effective adjustment to win rate measurement. Specifically, AdapAlpaca\nensures a fair comparison of response quality by aligning the lengths of\nreference and test model responses under equivalent length intervals.",

    "summary": "Scientific research is inherently global. However, the vast majority of\nacademic journals are published exclusively in English, creating barriers for\nnon-native-English-speaking researchers. In this study, we leverage large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to translate published scientific articles while\npreserving their native JATS XML formatting, thereby developing a practical,\nautomated approach for implementation by academic journals. Using our approach,\nwe translate articles across multiple scientific disciplines into 28 languages.\nTo evaluate translation accuracy, we introduce a novel question-and-answer (QA)\nbenchmarking method, in which an LLM generates comprehension-based questions\nfrom the original text and then answers them based on the translated text. Our\nbenchmark results show an average performance of 95.9%, showing that the key\nscientific details are accurately conveyed. In a user study, we translate the\nscientific papers of 15 researchers into their native languages, finding that\nthe authors consistently found the translations to accurately capture the\noriginal information in their articles. Interestingly, a third of the authors\nfound many technical terms \"overtranslated,\" expressing a preference to keep\nterminology more familiar in English untranslated. Finally, we demonstrate how\nin-context learning techniques can be used to align translations with\ndomain-specific preferences such as mitigating overtranslation, highlighting\nthe adaptability and utility of LLM-driven scientific translation.

    "summary": "We present MuMTAffect, a novel Multimodal Multitask Affective Embedding\nNetwork designed for joint emotion classification and personality prediction\n(re-identification) from short physiological signal segments. MuMTAffect\nintegrates multiple physiological modalities pupil dilation, eye gaze, facial\naction units, and galvanic skin response using dedicated, transformer-based\nencoders for each modality and a fusion transformer to model cross-modal\ninteractions. Inspired by the Theory of Constructed Emotion, the architecture\nexplicitly separates core affect encoding (valence/arousal) from higher-level\nconceptualization, thereby grounding predictions in contemporary affective\nneuroscience. Personality trait prediction is leveraged as an auxiliary task to\ngenerate robust, user-specific affective embeddings, significantly enhancing\nemotion recognition performance. We evaluate MuMTAffect on the AFFEC dataset,\ndemonstrating that stimulus-level emotional cues (Stim Emo) and galvanic skin\nresponse substantially improve arousal classification, while pupil and gaze\ndata enhance valence discrimination. The inherent modularity of MuMTAffect\nallows effortless integration of additional modalities, ensuring scalability\nand adaptability.

However, many large-scale text-to-image systems are\ndesigned for broad applicability, yielding conventional output that may limit\ncreative exploration. They also employ interaction methods that may be\ndifficult for beginners. Given that creative end users often operate in\ndiverse, context-specific ways that are often unpredictable, more variation and\npersonalization are necessary. We introduce POET, a real-time interactive tool\nthat (1) automatically discovers dimensions of homogeneity in text-to-image\ngenerative models, (2) expands these dimensions to diversify the output space\nof generated images, and (3) learns from user feedback to personalize\nexpansions. An evaluation with 28 users spanning four creative task domains\ndemonstrated POET's ability to generate results with higher perceived diversity\nand help users reach satisfaction in fewer prompts during creative tasks,\nthereby prompting them to deliberate and reflect more on a wider range of\npossible produced results during the co-creative process. Focusing on visual\ncreativity, POET offers a first glimpse of how interaction techniques of future\ntext-to-image generation tools may support and align with more pluralistic\nvalues and the needs of end users during the ideation stages of their work.",

    "title": "OneSearch: A Preliminary Exploration of the Unified End-to-End   Generative Framework for E-commerce Search",
    "summary": "Traditional e-commerce search systems employ multi-stage cascading\narchitectures (MCA) that progressively filter items through recall,\npre-ranking, and ranking stages. While effective at balancing computational\nefficiency with business conversion, these systems suffer from fragmented\ncomputation and optimization objective collisions across stages, which\nultimately limit their performance ceiling. To address these, we propose\n\\textbf{OneSearch}, the first industrial-deployed end-to-end generative\nframework for e-commerce search. This framework introduces three key\ninnovations: (1) a Keyword-enhanced Hierarchical Quantization Encoding (KHQE)\nmodule, to preserve both hierarchical semantics and distinctive item attributes\nwhile maintaining strong query-item relevance constraints; (2) a multi-view\nuser behavior sequence injection strategy that constructs behavior-driven user\nIDs and incorporates both explicit short-term and implicit long-term sequences\nto model user preferences comprehensively; and (3) a Preference-Aware Reward\nSystem (PARS) featuring multi-stage supervised fine-tuning and adaptive\nreward-weighted ranking to capture fine-grained user preferences. Extensive\noffline evaluations on large-scale industry datasets demonstrate OneSearch's\nsuperior performance for high-quality recall and ranking. The rigorous online\nA/B tests confirm its ability to enhance relevance in the same exposure\nposition, achieving statistically significant improvements: +1.67\\% item CTR,\n+2.40\\% buyer, and +3.22\\% order volume. Furthermore, OneSearch reduces\noperational expenditure by 75.40\\% and improves Model FLOPs Utilization from\n3.26\\% to 27.32\\%. The system has been successfully deployed across multiple\nsearch scenarios in Kuaishou, serving millions of users, generating tens of\nmillions of PVs daily.",

    "summary": "Recent advancements in neural representations, such as Neural Radiance Fields\nand 3D Gaussian Splatting, have increased interest in applying style transfer\nto 3D scenes. While existing methods can transfer style patterns onto\n3D-consistent neural representations, they struggle to effectively extract and\ntransfer high-level style semantics from the reference style image.\nAdditionally, the stylized results often lack structural clarity and\nseparation, making it difficult to distinguish between different instances or\nobjects within the 3D scene. To address these limitations, we propose a novel\n3D style transfer pipeline that effectively integrates prior knowledge from\npretrained 2D diffusion models. Our pipeline consists of two key stages: First,\nwe leverage diffusion priors to generate stylized renderings of key viewpoints.\nThen, we transfer the stylized key views onto the 3D representation. This\nprocess incorporates two innovative designs. The first is cross-view style\nalignment, which inserts cross-view attention into the last upsampling block of\nthe UNet, allowing feature interactions across multiple key views. This ensures\nthat the diffusion model generates stylized key views that maintain both style\nfidelity and instance-level consistency. The second is instance-level style\ntransfer, which effectively leverages instance-level consistency across\nstylized key views and transfers it onto the 3D representation. This results in\na more structured, visually coherent, and artistically enriched stylization.\nExtensive qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our 3D\nstyle transfer pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods\nacross a wide range of scenes, from forward-facing to challenging 360-degree\nenvironments.

In the last decades, the production and design of such\nbatteries and their adjacent embedded charging and safety protocols, denoted by\nBattery Management Systems (BMS), has taken central stage. A fundamental\nchallenge to be addressed is the trade-off between the speed of charging and\nthe ageing behavior, resulting in the loss of capacity in the battery cell. We\nrely on a high-fidelity physics-based battery model and propose an approach to\ndata-driven charging and safety protocol design. Following a\nCounterexample-Guided Inductive Synthesis scheme, we combine Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) with recent developments in data-driven formal methods to obtain\na hybrid control strategy: RL is used to synthesise the individual controllers,\nand a data-driven abstraction guides their partitioning into a switched\nstructure, depending on the initial output measurements of the battery. The\nresulting discrete selection among RL-based controllers, coupled with the\ncontinuous battery dynamics, realises a hybrid system. When a design meets the\ndesired criteria, the abstraction provides probabilistic guarantees on the\nclosed-loop performance of the cell.",

    "summary": "Deep models have recently emerged as promising tools to solve partial\ndifferential equations (PDEs), known as neural PDE solvers. While neural\nsolvers trained from either simulation data or physics-informed loss can solve\nPDEs reasonably well, they are mainly restricted to a few instances of PDEs,\ne.g. a certain equation with a limited set of coefficients. This limits their\ngeneralization to diverse PDEs, preventing them from being practical surrogate\nmodels of numerical solvers. In this paper, we present Unisolver, a novel\nTransformer model trained on diverse data and conditioned on diverse PDEs,\naiming towards a universal neural PDE solver capable of solving a wide scope of\nPDEs. Instead of purely scaling up data and parameters, Unisolver stems from\nthe theoretical analysis of the PDE-solving process. Inspired by the\nmathematical structure of PDEs that a PDE solution is fundamentally governed by\na series of PDE components such as equation symbols and boundary conditions, we\ndefine a complete set of PDE components and flexibly embed them as domain-wise\nand point-wise deep conditions for Transformer PDE solvers. Integrating\nphysical insights with recent Transformer advances, Unisolver achieves\nconsistent state-of-the-art on three challenging large-scale benchmarks,\nshowing impressive performance and generalizability.

    "summary": "In the rapidly evolving software development landscape, Python stands out for\nits simplicity, versatility, and extensive ecosystem. Python packages, as units\nof organization, reusability, and distribution, have become a pressing concern,\nhighlighted by the considerable number of vulnerability reports. As a scripting\nlanguage, Python often cooperates with other languages for performance or\ninteroperability. This adds complexity to the vulnerabilities inherent to\nPython packages, and the effectiveness of current vulnerability detection tools\nremains underexplored. This paper addresses these gaps by introducing PyVul,\nthe first comprehensive benchmark suite of Python-package vulnerabilities.\nPyVul includes 1,157 publicly reported, developer-verified vulnerabilities,\neach linked to its affected packages. To accommodate diverse detection\ntechniques, it provides annotations at both commit and function levels. An\nLLM-assisted data cleansing method is incorporated to improve label accuracy,\nachieving 100% commit-level and 94% function-level accuracy, establishing PyVul\nas the most precise large-scale Python vulnerability benchmark. We further\ncarry out a distribution analysis of PyVul, which demonstrates that\nvulnerabilities in Python packages involve multiple programming languages and\nexhibit a wide variety of types. Moreover, our analysis reveals that\nmulti-lingual Python packages are potentially more susceptible to\nvulnerabilities. Evaluation of state-of-the-art detectors using this benchmark\nreveals a significant discrepancy between the capabilities of existing tools\nand the demands of effectively identifying real-world security issues in Python\npackages. Additionally, we conduct an empirical review of the top-ranked CWEs\nobserved in Python packages, to diagnose the fine-grained limitations of\ncurrent detection tools and highlight the necessity for future advancements in\nthe field.",

    "summary": "Synthesizing diverse, uncertainty-aware grasps for multi-fingered hands from\npartial observations remains a critical challenge in robot learning. Prior\ngenerative methods struggle to model the intricate grasp distribution of\ndexterous hands and often fail to reason about shape uncertainty inherent in\npartial point clouds, leading to unreliable or overly conservative grasps. We\npropose FFHFlow, a flow-based variational framework that generates diverse,\nrobust multi-finger grasps while explicitly quantifying perceptual uncertainty\nin the partial point clouds. Our approach leverages a normalizing flow-based\ndeep latent variable model to learn a hierarchical grasp manifold, overcoming\nthe mode collapse and rigid prior limitations of conditional Variational\nAutoencoders (cVAEs). By exploiting the invertibility and exact likelihoods of\nflows, FFHFlow introspects shape uncertainty in partial observations and\nidentifies novel object structures, enabling risk-aware grasp synthesis. To\nfurther enhance reliability, we integrate a discriminative grasp evaluator with\nthe flow likelihoods, formulating an uncertainty-aware ranking strategy that\nprioritizes grasps robust to shape ambiguity. Extensive experiments in\nsimulation and real-world setups demonstrate that FFHFlow outperforms\nstate-of-the-art baselines (including diffusion models) in grasp diversity and\nsuccess rate, while achieving run-time efficient sampling. We also showcase its\npractical value in cluttered and confined environments, where diversity-driven\nsampling excels by mitigating collisions (Project Page:\nhttps://sites.google.com/view/ffhflow/home/).",

    "summary": "Human expertise emerges through iterative cycles of interaction, reflection,\nand internal model updating, which are central to cognitive theories such as\nKolb's experiential learning and Vygotsky's zone of proximal development. In\ncontrast, current AI systems, particularly LLM agents, rely on static\npre-training or rigid workflows, lacking mechanisms for continual adaptation.\nRecent studies identified early cognitive traits in LLM agents (reflection,\nrevision, and self-correction) suggesting foundational elements of human-like\nexperiential learning. Thus the key question: Can we design LLM agents capable\nof structured, cognitively grounded learning similar to human processes? In\nresponse, we propose a computational framework of Kolb's learning cycle with\nVygotsky's ZPD for autonomous agents. Our architecture separates extrinsic\n(environment interaction) and intrinsic (internal reflection/abstraction)\nfunctions, enabling cognitively grounded scaffolded learning, where the agent\ninitially learns within structured environments, followed by open-ended\ngeneralisation. This approach empowers agents to master complex tasks ; domains\nthat traditional fine-tuning or simple reflective methods could not tackle\neffectively. Its potential is powerfully demonstrated via direct comparison\nwith humans in real-world Kaggle data science competitions. Learning fully\nautomated data science code generation across 81 tasks, our system, Agent K,\ndemonstrated the ability to perform the entire workflow autonomously, achieving\nan Elo-MMR score of 1694, beyond median score of the Kaggle Masters (the top 2%\namong 200,000 users) of our study.

By imposing a linear dynamics model with simultaneously\ndiagonalizable state matrices and noise covariances, we can make use of a\nclosed-form solution to the differential Lyapunov equation to efficiently\npropagate pairwise uncertainties through the dynamics. Attention naturally\narises as the maximum likelihood solution for this linear SDE, with attention\nweights corresponding to robust residual-based reweightings of the propagated\npairwise precisions. Imposing an additional constraint on the state matrix's\neigenvalues leads to a simplified variant with the same computational and\nmemory complexity as standard attention.

The approach effectively\nreduces the size of the solver's search space, significantly speeding up route\noptimization. Although global optimality is not guaranteed, empirical results\nconducted with Airbus aircraft's performance models show that fuel consumption\nremains nearly identical to that of an unconstrained solver, with deviations\ntypically within 1%.

To address these issues, we\nintroduce PIN (Paired and INterleaved multimodal documents), a novel data\nformat designed to foster a deeper integration of visual and textual knowledge.\nThe PIN format uniquely combines semantically rich Markdown files, which\npreserve fine-grained textual structures, with holistic overall images that\ncapture the complete document layout. Following this format, we construct and\nrelease two large-scale, open-source datasets: PIN-200M (~200 million\ndocuments) and PIN-14M (~14 million), compiled from diverse web and scientific\nsources in both English and Chinese. To maximize usability, we provide detailed\nstatistical analyses and equip the datasets with quality signals, enabling\nresearchers to easily filter and select data for specific tasks. Our work\nprovides the community with a versatile data format and substantial resources,\noffering a foundation for new research in pre-training strategies and the\ndevelopment of more powerful knowledge-intensive LMMs.",

Despite their\nunique characteristics, ODIs exhibit remarkable differences from perspective\nimages in geometric projection, spatial distribution, and boundary continuity,\nmaking it challenging for direct domain adaption from perspective methods. This\nsurvey reviews recent panoramic vision techniques with a particular emphasis on\nthe perspective-to-panorama adaptation. We first revisit the panoramic imaging\npipeline and projection methods to build the prior knowledge required for\nanalyzing the structural disparities. Then, we summarize three challenges of\ndomain adaptation: severe geometric distortions near the poles, non-uniform\nsampling in Equirectangular Projection (ERP), and periodic boundary continuity.\nBuilding on this, we cover 20+ representative tasks drawn from more than 300\nresearch papers in two dimensions. On one hand, we present a cross-method\nanalysis of representative strategies for addressing panoramic specific\nchallenges across different tasks. On the other hand, we conduct a cross-task\ncomparison and classify panoramic vision into four major categories: visual\nquality enhancement and assessment, visual understanding, multimodal\nunderstanding, and visual generation. In addition, we discuss open challenges\nand future directions in data, models, and applications that will drive the\nadvancement of panoramic vision research. We hope that our work can provide new\ninsight and forward looking perspectives to advance the development of\npanoramic vision technologies.

To enable high-fidelity and spatially\nconsistent attribute transfer across frames, we introduce dual reference\nnetworks that inject spatial features from both the portrait and attribute\nimages into the denoising process of a diffusion model. We train the model\nusing a self-reconstruction formulation, where two frames are sampled from the\nsame portrait video: one is treated as the attribute reference and the other as\nthe target portrait, and the remaining frames are reconstructed conditioned on\nthese inputs and their corresponding masks.

    "summary": "Flow-based 3D generation models typically require dozens of sampling steps\nduring inference. Though few-step distillation methods, particularly\nConsistency Models (CMs), have achieved substantial advancements in\naccelerating 2D diffusion models, they remain under-explored for more complex\n3D generation tasks. In this study, we propose a novel framework, MDT-dist, for\nfew-step 3D flow distillation. Our approach is built upon a primary objective:\ndistilling the pretrained model to learn the Marginal-Data Transport. Directly\nlearning this objective needs to integrate the velocity fields, while this\nintegral is intractable to be implemented. Therefore, we propose two\noptimizable objectives, Velocity Matching (VM) and Velocity Distillation (VD),\nto equivalently convert the optimization target from the transport level to the\nvelocity and the distribution level respectively. Velocity Matching (VM) learns\nto stably match the velocity fields between the student and the teacher, but\ninevitably provides biased gradient estimates. Velocity Distillation (VD)\nfurther enhances the optimization process by leveraging the learned velocity\nfields to perform probability density distillation. When evaluated on the\npioneer 3D generation framework TRELLIS, our method reduces sampling steps of\neach flow transformer from 25 to 1 or 2, achieving 0.68s (1 step x 2) and 0.94s\n(2 steps x 2) latency with 9.0x and 6.5x speedup on A800, while preserving high\nvisual and geometric fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our\nmethod significantly outperforms existing CM distillation methods, and enables\nTRELLIS to achieve superior performance in few-step 3D generation.",

    "summary": "Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to selectively erase harmful behaviors from\nmodels while retaining the overall utility of the model. As a multi-task\nlearning problem, MU involves balancing objectives related to forgetting\nspecific concepts/data and preserving general performance. A naive integration\nof these forgetting and preserving objectives can lead to gradient conflicts\nand dominance, impeding MU algorithms from reaching optimal solutions. To\naddress the gradient conflict and dominance issue, we reformulate MU as a\ntwo-player cooperative game, where the two players, namely, the forgetting\nplayer and the preservation player, contribute via their gradient proposals to\nmaximize their overall gain and balance their contributions. To this end,\ninspired by the Nash bargaining theory, we derive a closed-form solution to\nguide the model toward the Pareto stationary point. Our formulation of MU\nguarantees an equilibrium solution, where any deviation from the final state\nwould lead to a reduction in the overall objectives for both players, ensuring\noptimality in each objective. We evaluate our algorithm's effectiveness on a\ndiverse set of tasks across image classification and image generation.\nExtensive experiments with ResNet, vision-language model CLIP, and\ntext-to-image diffusion models demonstrate that our method outperforms\nstate-of-the-art MU algorithms, achieving a better trade-off between forgetting\nand preserving. Our results also highlight improvements in forgetting\nprecision, preservation of generalization, and robustness against adversarial\nattacks.",

    "summary": "Recently, deep learning-based methods have dominated image dehazing domain. A\nmulti-receptive-field non-local network (MRFNLN) consisting of the multi-stream\nfeature attention block (MSFAB) and the cross non-local block (CNLB) is\npresented in this paper to further enhance the performance. We start with\nextracting richer features for dehazing. Specifically, a multi-stream feature\nextraction (MSFE) sub-block, which contains three parallel convolutions with\ndifferent receptive fields (i.e., $1\\times 1$, $3\\times 3$, $5\\times 5$), is\ndesigned for extracting multi-scale features. Following MSFE, an attention\nsub-block is employed to make the model adaptively focus on important\nchannels/regions. These two sub-blocks constitute our MSFAB. Then, we design a\ncross non-local block (CNLB), which can capture long-range dependencies beyond\nthe query. Instead of the same input source of query branch, the key and value\nbranches are enhanced by fusing more preceding features. CNLB is\ncomputation-friendly by leveraging a spatial pyramid down-sampling (SPDS)\nstrategy to reduce the computation and memory consumption without sacrificing\nthe performance. Last but not least, a novel detail-focused contrastive\nregularization (DFCR) is presented by emphasizing the low-level details and\nignoring the high-level semantic information in a representation space\nspecially designed for dehazing. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed MRFNLN model outperforms recent state-of-the-art dehazing\nmethods with less than 1.5 Million parameters.",

    "summary": "Recent studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can exhibit bias\nin real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in ethically sensitive\ndomains such as healthcare. Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,\nmodel generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social\ndiscrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing\ndebiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and\nneed extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between\nmodel fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we\npropose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that\nefficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with\nmuch less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external\ndataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to\nfirst find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to\nboth bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process\nupdates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its\ncontribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes\n(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray\ndatasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while\nachieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common\nfairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically,\nwe demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior\nperformance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.",

    "summary": "Pollinator insects such as honeybees and bumblebees are vital to global food\nproduction and ecosystem stability, yet their populations are declining due to\nanthropogenic and environmental stressors. Scalable, automated monitoring in\nagricultural environments remains an open challenge due to the difficulty of\ndetecting small, fast-moving, and often camouflaged insects. To address this,\nwe present BuzzSet v1.0, a large-scale dataset of high-resolution pollinator\nimages collected under real field conditions. BuzzSet contains 7,856 manually\nverified images with more than 8,000 annotated instances across three classes:\nhoneybees, bumblebees, and unidentified insects. Initial annotations were\nproduced using a YOLOv12 model trained on external data and refined through\nhuman verification with open-source tools. All images were preprocessed into\n256 x 256 tiles to improve the detection of small insects. We provide baselines\nusing the RF-DETR transformer-based object detector. The model achieves strong\nclassification accuracy with F1 scores of 0.94 and 0.92 for honeybees and\nbumblebees, with minimal confusion between these categories. The unidentified\nclass remains more difficult due to label ambiguity and fewer samples, yet\nstill contributes insights for robustness evaluation. Overall detection\nperformance (mAP at 0.50 of 0.559) illustrates the challenging nature of the\ndataset and its potential to drive advances in small object detection under\nrealistic ecological conditions. Future work focuses on expanding the dataset\nto version 2.0 with additional annotations and evaluating further detection\nstrategies. BuzzSet establishes a benchmark for ecological computer vision,\nwith the primary challenge being reliable detection of insects frequently\ncamouflaged within natural vegetation, highlighting an open problem for future\nresearch.",

We provide an intuitive theoretical analysis of our\napproaches under appropriate conditions and validate their superiority through\nextensive experiments on diverse image datasets, encompassing both linear and\nnonlinear IPs.

Furthermore, we investigate strategies to enhance LLMs'\nperformance including refinement through external feedback from Proof\nAssistants, and formal definition grounding, where we augment LLMs'\nformalizations through relevant contextual elements from formal mathematical\nlibraries. Our findings reveal that definitions present a greater challenge\ncompared to existing benchmarks, such as miniF2F. In particular, we found that\nLLMs still struggle with self-correction, and aligning with relevant\nmathematical libraries.

    "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have ushered in a new era for document-level\nmachine translation (\\textit{doc}-mt), yet their whole-document outputs\nchallenge existing evaluation methods that assume sentence-by-sentence\nalignment. We introduce \\textit{\\textbf{Align-then-Slide}}, a complete\nevaluation framework for ultra-long doc-mt. In the Align stage, we\nautomatically infer sentence-level source-target correspondences and rebuild\nthe target to match the source sentence number, resolving omissions and\nmany-to-one/one-to-many mappings. In the n-Chunk Sliding Evaluate stage, we\ncalculate averaged metric scores under 1-, 2-, 3- and 4-chunk for\nmulti-granularity assessment. Experiments on the WMT benchmark show a Pearson\ncorrelation of 0.929 between our method with expert MQM rankings. On a newly\ncurated real-world test set, our method again aligns closely with human\njudgments. Furthermore, preference data produced by Align-then-Slide enables\neffective CPO training and its direct use as a reward model for GRPO, both\nyielding translations preferred over a vanilla SFT baseline. The results\nvalidate our framework as an accurate, robust, and actionable evaluation tool\nfor doc-mt systems.",

    "title": "Evaluating the Robustness of Retrieval-Augmented Generation to   Adversarial Evidence in the Health Domain",
    "summary": "Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems provide a method for factually\ngrounding the responses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by providing retrieved\nevidence, or context, as support. Guided by this context, RAG systems can\nreduce hallucinations and expand the ability of LLMs to accurately answer\nquestions outside the scope of their training data. Unfortunately, this design\nintroduces a critical vulnerability: LLMs may absorb and reproduce\nmisinformation present in retrieved evidence. This problem is magnified if\nretrieved evidence contains adversarial material explicitly intended to\npromulgate misinformation. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of RAG\nrobustness in the health domain and examines alignment between model outputs\nand ground-truth answers. We focus on the health domain due to the potential\nfor harm caused by incorrect responses, as well as the availability of\nevidence-based ground truth for many common health-related questions. We\nconduct controlled experiments using common health questions, varying both the\ntype and composition of the retrieved documents (helpful, harmful, and\nadversarial) as well as the framing of the question by the user (consistent,\nneutral, and inconsistent). Our findings reveal that adversarial documents\nsubstantially degrade alignment, but robustness can be preserved when helpful\nevidence is also present in the retrieval pool. These findings offer actionable\ninsights for designing safer RAG systems in high-stakes domains by highlighting\nthe need for retrieval safeguards. To enable reproducibility and facilitate\nfuture research, all experimental results are publicly available in our github\nrepository.\n  https://github.com/shakibaam/RAG_ROBUSTNESS_EVAL",

    "summary": "Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have achieved significant advances in a wide\nrange of applications. However, their deployment on resource-constrained\ndevices remains a challenge due to the large number of layers and parameters,\nwhich result in considerable computational and memory demands. To address this\nissue, pruning and quantization are two widely used compression techniques,\ncommonly applied individually in most studies to reduce model size and enhance\nprocessing speed. Nevertheless, combining these two techniques can yield even\ngreater compression benefits. Effectively integrating pruning and quantization\nto harness their complementary advantages poses a challenging task, primarily\ndue to their potential impact on model accuracy and the complexity of jointly\noptimizing both processes. In this paper, we propose two approaches that\nintegrate similarity-based filter pruning with Adaptive Power-of-Two (APoT)\nquantization to achieve higher compression efficiency while preserving model\naccuracy. In the first approach, pruning and quantization are applied\nsimultaneously during training. In the second approach, pruning is performed\nfirst to remove less important parameters, followed by quantization of the\npruned model using low-bit representations. Experimental results demonstrate\nthat our proposed approaches achieve effective model compression with minimal\naccuracy degradation, making them well-suited for deployment on devices with\nlimited computational resources.",

The DRLR framework is developed based on an algorithm called\nImitation Bootstrapped Reinforcement Learning (IBRL). We propose to improve\nIBRL by modifying the action selection module. The proposed action selection\nmodule provides a calibrated Q-value, which mitigates the bootstrapping error\nthat otherwise leads to inefficient exploration. Furthermore, to prevent the RL\npolicy from converging to a sub-optimal policy, SAC is used as the RL policy\ninstead of TD3. The effectiveness of our method in mitigating bootstrapping\nerror and preventing overfitting is empirically validated by learning two\nrobotics tasks: bucket loading and open drawer, which require extensive\ninteractions with the environment. Simulation results also demonstrate the\nrobustness of the DRLR framework across tasks with both low and high\nstate-action dimensions, and varying demonstration qualities. To evaluate the\ndeveloped framework on a real-world industrial robotics task, the bucket\nloading task is deployed on a real wheel loader.

Existing\nmethods primarily focus on single-object grasping or grasp-pose prediction\nwithout interaction, which are insufficient for complex, cluttered scenes.\nRecent vision-language-action models offer a potential solution but require\nextensive real-world demonstrations, making them costly and difficult to scale.\nTo address these limitations, we revisit the sim-to-real transfer pipeline and\ndevelop key techniques that enable zero-shot deployment in reality while\nmaintaining robust generalization. We propose ClutterDexGrasp, a two-stage\nteacher-student framework for closed-loop target-oriented dexterous grasping in\ncluttered scenes. The framework features a teacher policy trained in simulation\nusing clutter density curriculum learning, incorporating both a geometry and\nspatially-embedded scene representation and a novel comprehensive safety\ncurriculum, enabling general, dynamic, and safe grasping behaviors. Through\nimitation learning, we distill the teacher's knowledge into a student 3D\ndiffusion policy (DP3) that operates on partial point cloud observations. To\nthe best of our knowledge, this represents the first zero-shot sim-to-real\nclosed-loop system for target-oriented dexterous grasping in cluttered scenes,\ndemonstrating robust performance across diverse objects and layouts.

Here, we present a spike-based decoding framework that integrates\nspiking neural networks (SNNs) with motor unit activity extracted from\nhigh-density intramuscular microelectrode arrays. We demonstrate simultaneous\nand proportional decoding of individual finger forces from motor unit spike\ntrains during isometric contractions at 15% of maximum voluntary contraction\nusing SNNs. We systematically evaluated alternative SNN decoder configurations\nand compared two possible input modalities: physiologically grounded motor unit\nspike trains and spike-encoded intramuscular EMG signals. Through this\ncomparison, we quantified trade-offs between decoding accuracy, memory\nfootprint, and robustness to input errors. The results showed that shallow SNNs\ncan reliably decode finger-level motor intent with competitive accuracy and\nminimal latency, while operating with reduced memory requirements and without\nthe need for external preprocessing buffers.

Although numerous deepfake detection methods have been developed,\ntheir effectiveness in real-world environments remains unrealiable due to the\ndomain shift between training and test samples arising from diverse human\nspeech and fast evolving speech synthesis systems. This is not adequately\naddressed by current datasets, which lack real-world application challenges\nwith diverse and up-to-date audios in both real and deep-fake categories. To\nfill this gap, we introduce AUDETER (AUdio DEepfake TEst Range), a large-scale,\nhighly diverse deepfake audio dataset for comprehensive evaluation and robust\ndevelopment of generalised models for deepfake audio detection. It consists of\nover 4,500 hours of synthetic audio generated by 11 recent TTS models and 10\nvocoders with a broad range of TTS/vocoder patterns, totalling 3 million audio\nclips, making it the largest deepfake audio dataset by scale. Through extensive\nexperiments with AUDETER, we reveal that i) state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods\ntrained on existing datasets struggle to generalise to novel deepfake audio\nsamples and suffer from high false positive rates on unseen human voice,\nunderscoring the need for a comprehensive dataset; and ii) these methods\ntrained on AUDETER achieve highly generalised detection performance and\nsignificantly reduce detection error rate by 44.1% to 51.6%, achieving an error\nrate of only 4.17% on diverse cross-domain samples in the popular In-the-Wild\ndataset, paving the way for training generalist deepfake audio detectors.\nAUDETER is available on GitHub.",

    "summary": "Theory of Mind (ToM) -- the ability to understand that others can have\ndiffering knowledge and goals -- enables agents to reason about others' beliefs\nwhile planning their own actions. We present a novel approach to multi-agent\ncooperation by implementing ToM within active inference. Unlike previous active\ninference approaches to multi-agent cooperation, our method neither relies on\ntask-specific shared generative models nor requires explicit communication. In\nour framework, ToM-equipped agents maintain distinct representations of their\nown and others' beliefs and goals. ToM agents then use an extended and adapted\nversion of the sophisticated inference tree-based planning algorithm to\nsystematically explore joint policy spaces through recursive reasoning. We\nevaluate our approach through collision avoidance and foraging simulations.\nResults suggest that ToM agents cooperate better compared to non-ToM\ncounterparts by being able to avoid collisions and reduce redundant efforts.\nCrucially, ToM agents accomplish this by inferring others' beliefs solely from\nobservable behaviour and considering them when planning their own actions. Our\napproach shows potential for generalisable and scalable multi-agent systems\nwhile providing computational insights into ToM mechanisms.",

    "summary": "There is growing interest in reinforcement learning (RL) methods that\nleverage the simulator's derivatives to improve learning efficiency. While\nearly gradient-based approaches have demonstrated superior performance compared\nto derivative-free methods, accessing simulator gradients is often impractical\ndue to their implementation cost or unavailability. Model-based RL (MBRL) can\napproximate these gradients via learned dynamics models, but the solver\nefficiency suffers from compounding prediction errors during training rollouts,\nwhich can degrade policy performance. We propose an approach that decouples\ntrajectory generation from gradient computation: trajectories are unrolled\nusing a simulator, while gradients are computed via backpropagation through a\nlearned differentiable model of the simulator. This hybrid design enables\nefficient and consistent first-order policy optimization, even when simulator\ngradients are unavailable, as well as learning a critic from simulation\nrollouts, which is more accurate. Our method achieves the sample efficiency and\nspeed of specialized optimizers such as SHAC, while maintaining the generality\nof standard approaches like PPO and avoiding ill behaviors observed in other\nfirst-order MBRL methods. We empirically validate our algorithm on benchmark\ncontrol tasks and demonstrate its effectiveness on a real Go2 quadruped robot,\nacross both quadrupedal and bipedal locomotion tasks.",

    "summary": "The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial\nclaims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should\nnot do. These range from rigorously studied health benefits (probiotics improve\ngut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague\npromises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods\ncause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for\ntracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and\nunderdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network\n(FCN) as an extension of FKG[.]in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we\nhave been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the\nsemi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of\nconcept of FKG[.]in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN\nintegrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware\npipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly\nlinked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology\nremains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or\nregulatory settings.

    "summary": "A key step in reverse engineering neural networks is to decompose them into\nsimpler parts that can be studied in relative isolation. Linear parameter\ndecomposition -- a framework that has been proposed to resolve several issues\nwith current decomposition methods -- decomposes neural network parameters into\na sum of sparsely used vectors in parameter space. However, the current main\nmethod in this framework, Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), is\nimpractical on account of its computational cost and sensitivity to\nhyperparameters. In this work, we introduce \\textit{Stochastic Parameter\nDecomposition} (SPD), a method that is more scalable and robust to\nhyperparameters than APD, which we demonstrate by decomposing models that are\nslightly larger and more complex than was possible to decompose with APD. We\nalso show that SPD avoids other issues, such as shrinkage of the learned\nparameters, and better identifies ground truth mechanisms in toy models. By\nbridging causal mediation analysis and network decomposition methods, this\ndemonstration opens up new research possibilities in mechanistic\ninterpretability by removing barriers to scaling linear parameter decomposition\nmethods to larger models.

However, most works on\ncomputer-poker focus on performance metrics such as win rates, while bluffing\nis overlooked. In this paper we study whether two popular algorithms, DQN\n(based on reinforcement learning) and CFR (based on game theory), exhibit\nbluffing behavior in Leduc Hold'em, a simplified version of poker. We designed\nan experiment where we let the DQN and CFR agent play against each other while\nwe log their actions. We find that both DQN and CFR exhibit bluffing behavior,\nbut they do so in different ways. Although both attempt to perform bluffs at\ndifferent rates, the percentage of successful bluffs (where the opponent folds)\nis roughly the same. This suggests that bluffing is an essential aspect of the\ngame, not of the algorithm. Future work should look at different bluffing\nstyles and at the full game of poker.

Recent research has begun to pay attention to the quality structures in\nNVCs, optimizing them by introducing explicit hierarchical designs. However,\nless attention has been paid to the reference structure design, which\nfundamentally should be aligned with the hierarchical quality structure. In\naddition, there is still significant room for further optimization of the\nhierarchical quality structure. To address these challenges in NVCs, we propose\nEHVC, an efficient hierarchical neural video codec featuring three key\ninnovations: (1) a hierarchical multi-reference scheme that draws on\ntraditional video codec design to align reference and quality structures,\nthereby addressing the reference-quality mismatch; (2) a lookahead strategy to\nutilize an encoder-side context from future frames to enhance the quality\nstructure; (3) a layer-wise quality scale with random quality training strategy\nto stabilize quality structures during inference.

We propose\na method that transcends this limitation, switching the focus from analyzing a\nmodel's predictions to analyzing the model's weights, the mechanism behind the\nmaking of the decisions, which proves to be more insightful. Our proposed\nWeight-space Approach to detecting Spuriousness (WASP) relies on analyzing the\nweights of foundation models as they drift towards capturing various (spurious)\ncorrelations while being fine-tuned on a given dataset. We demonstrate that\ndifferent from previous works, our method (i) can expose spurious correlations\nfeatured by a dataset even when they are not exposed by training or validation\ncounterexamples, (ii) it works for multiple modalities such as image and text,\nand (iii) it can uncover previously untapped spurious correlations learned by\nImageNet-1k classifiers.",

Traditionally, these connections have been focusing\nmostly on the relation between string theory and image processing and involve\nimportant theoretical paradigms such as holography. Recently G. Bianconi has\nformulated the Gravity from Entropy (GfE) approach to quantum gravity in which\ngravity is derived from the geometric quantum relative entropy (GQRE) between\ntwo metrics associated with the Lorentzian spacetime. Here it is demonstrated\nthat the famous Perona-Malik algorithm for image processing is the gradient\nflow of the GfE action in its simple warm-up scenario. Specifically, this\nalgorithm is the outcome of the minimization of the GQRE between two Euclidean\nmetrics: the one of the support of the image and the one induced by the image.\nAs the Perona-Malik algorithm is known to preserve sharp contours, this implies\nthat the GfE action, does not in general lead to uniform images upon iteration\nof the gradient flow dynamics as it would be intuitively expected from entropic\nactions maximising classical entropies. Rather, the outcome of the minimization\nof the GQRE is compatible with the preservation of complex structures. These\nresults provide the geometrical and information theory foundations for the\nPerona-Malik algorithm and might contribute to establish deeper connections\nbetween GfE, machine learning and brain research.",

    "summary": "Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) model the activations of a neural network as\nlinear combinations of sparsely occurring directions of variation (latents).\nThe ability of SAEs to reconstruct activations follows scaling laws w.r.t. the\nnumber of latents. In this work, we adapt a capacity-allocation model from the\nneural scaling literature (Brill, 2024) to understand SAE scaling, and in\nparticular, to understand how \"feature manifolds\" (multi-dimensional features)\ninfluence scaling behavior. Consistent with prior work, the model recovers\ndistinct scaling regimes. Notably, in one regime, feature manifolds have the\npathological effect of causing SAEs to learn far fewer features in data than\nthere are latents in the SAE. We provide some preliminary discussion on whether\nor not SAEs are in this pathological regime in the wild.",

    "summary": "Relevant combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) are often NP-hard. While\nthey have been tackled mainly via handcrafted heuristics in the past, advances\nin neural networks have motivated the development of general methods to learn\nheuristics from data. Many approaches utilize a neural network to directly\nconstruct a solution, but are limited in further improving based on already\nconstructed solutions at inference time. Our approach, Moco, defines a\nlightweight solution construction procedure, guided by a single continuous\nvector $\\theta$ (called heatmap) and learns a neural network to update $\\theta$\nfor a single instance of a COP at inference time. The update is based on\nvarious features of the current search state. The training procedure is budget\naware, targeting the overall best solution found during the entire search. Moco\nis a fully learnable meta optimizer not utilizing problem specific heuristics\nor requiring optimal solutions for training. We test Moco on the Traveling\nSalesman Problem (TSP) and Maximum Independent Set (MIS) and show that it\nsignificantly improves over other heatmap based methods.",

We prove a unified pseudoentropy characterization\nthat generalizes and strengthens previous results for both uniform and\nnon-uniform models of computation. Our characterization holds for a general\nfamily of entropy notions that encompasses the common notions of Shannon\nentropy and min entropy as special cases. Moreover, we show that the\ncharacterizations for different entropy notions can be simultaneously achieved\nby a single, universal function that simultaneously witnesses computational\nhardness and computational randomness. A key technical insight of our work is\nthat the notion of weight-restricted calibration from the recent literature on\nalgorithm fairness, along with standard computational indistinguishability\n(known as multiaccuracy in the fairness literature), suffices for proving\npseudoentropy characterizations for general entropy notions. This demonstrates\nthe power of weight-restricted calibration to enhance the classic\nComplexity-Theoretic Regularity Lemma (Trevisan, Tulsiani, and Vadhan, 2009)\nand Leakage Simulation Lemma (Jetchev and Pietrzak, 2014) and allows us to\nachieve an exponential improvement in the complexity dependency on the alphabet\nsize compared to the pseudoentropy characterizations by Casacuberta, Dwork, and\nVadhan (2024) based on the much stronger notion of multicalibration.

Selecting the optimal balance is a critical challenge that can be\nframed as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem where one first\ndiscovers the set of optimal trade-offs (the Pareto front) and then learns a\ndecision-maker's preference over them. While a rich body of work on interactive\nMOO exists, the standard approach -- modeling the objective functions with\ngeneric surrogates and learning preferences from simple pairwise feedback -- is\ninefficient for DP because it fails to leverage the problem's unique structure:\na point on the Pareto front can be generated directly by maximizing accuracy\nfor a fixed privacy level. Motivated by this property, we first derive the\nshape of the trade-off theoretically, which allows us to model the Pareto front\ndirectly and efficiently. To address inefficiency in preference learning, we\nreplace pairwise comparisons with a more informative interaction. In\nparticular, we present the user with hypothetical trade-off curves and ask them\nto pick their preferred trade-off.

Existing methods usually solve the problem with limited\nresolution of spatial discretization, and/or cannot deal with complex practical\nconstraints well. We propose to enhance the practical applicability of online\n3D-BPP via learning on a novel hierarchical representation, packing\nconfiguration tree (PCT). PCT is a full-fledged description of the state and\naction space of bin packing which can support packing policy learning based on\ndeep reinforcement learning (DRL). The size of the packing action space is\nproportional to the number of leaf nodes, making the DRL model easy to train\nand well-performing even with continuous solution space. We further discover\nthe potential of PCT as tree-based planners in deliberately solving packing\nproblems of industrial significance, including large-scale packing and\ndifferent variations of BPP setting. A recursive packing method is proposed to\ndecompose large-scale packing into smaller sub-trees while a spatial ensemble\nmechanism integrates local solutions into global. For different BPP variations\nwith additional decision variables, such as lookahead, buffering, and offline\npacking, we propose a unified planning framework enabling out-of-the-box\nproblem solving. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method outperforms\nexisting online BPP baselines and is versatile in incorporating various\npractical constraints.

    "summary": "This paper presents a novel methodology for determining representational\nstructure, which builds upon the existing Spotlight Resonance method. This new\ntool is used to gain insight into how discrete representations can emerge and\norganise in autoencoder models, through a controlled ablation study in which\nonly the activation function is altered. Using this technique, the validity of\nwhether function-driven symmetries can act as implicit inductive biases on\nrepresentations is determined. Representations are found to tend to discretise\nwhen the activation functions are defined through a discrete algebraic\npermutation-equivariant symmetry. In contrast, they remain continuous under a\ncontinuous algebraic orthogonal-equivariant definition. This confirms the\nhypothesis that the symmetries of network primitives can carry unintended\ninductive biases, which produce task-independent artefactual structures in\nrepresentations. The discrete symmetry of contemporary forms is shown to be a\nstrong predictor for the production of discrete representations emerging from\notherwise continuous distributions -- a quantisation effect. This motivates\nfurther reassessment of functional forms in common usage due to such unintended\nconsequences. Moreover, this supports a general causal model for one mode in\nwhich discrete representations may form, and could constitute a prerequisite\nfor downstream interpretability phenomena, including grandmother neurons,\ndiscrete coding schemes, general linear features and possibly Superposition.\nHence, this tool and proposed mechanism for the influence of functional form on\nrepresentations may provide insights into interpretability research. Finally,\npreliminary results indicate that quantisation of representations appears to\ncorrelate with a measurable increase in reconstruction error, reinforcing\nprevious conjectures that this collapse can be detrimental.",

    "title": "On Aligning Prediction Models with Clinical Experiential Learning: A   Prostate Cancer Case Study",
    "summary": "Over the past decade, the use of machine learning (ML) models in healthcare\napplications has rapidly increased. Despite high performance, modern ML models\ndo not always capture patterns the end user requires. For example, a model may\npredict a non-monotonically decreasing relationship between cancer stage and\nsurvival, keeping all other features fixed. In this paper, we present a\nreproducible framework for investigating this misalignment between model\nbehavior and clinical experiential learning, focusing on the effects of\nunderspecification of modern ML pipelines. In a prostate cancer outcome\nprediction case study, we first identify and address these inconsistencies by\nincorporating clinical knowledge, collected by a survey, via constraints into\nthe ML model, and subsequently analyze the impact on model performance and\nbehavior across degrees of underspecification. The approach shows that aligning\nthe ML model with clinical experiential learning is possible without\ncompromising performance. Motivated by recent literature in generative AI, we\nfurther examine the feasibility of a feedback-driven alignment approach in\nnon-generative AI clinical risk prediction models through a randomized\nexperiment with clinicians. Our findings illustrate that, by eliciting\nclinicians' model preferences using our proposed methodology, the larger the\ndifference in how the constrained and unconstrained models make predictions for\na patient, the more apparent the difference is in clinical interpretation.",

    "title": "TensoIS: A Step Towards Feed-Forward Tensorial Inverse Subsurface   Scattering for Perlin Distributed Heterogeneous Media",
    "summary": "Estimating scattering parameters of heterogeneous media from images is a\nseverely under-constrained and challenging problem. Most of the existing\napproaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,\napproximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering\ntechniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have\napplied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,\nbut they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is\nknown to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters\nin the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal\nPerlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of\nnatural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create\nHeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of\nheterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal\nPerlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a\nlearning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed\nheterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.\nInstead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses\nlearnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We\nevaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the\nHeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source\nrealistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its\neffectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to\nexplore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined\ndistribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous\nscattering in a feed-forward manner.",

However, its full\npotential is constrained by the critical challenge of accurately reconstructing\nimages when the illuminating probe is unknown. Conventional iterative methods\nand deep learning approaches are often suboptimal, particularly under the\nlow-signal conditions inherent to low-dose and high-speed experiments.

In this work, we introduce the Ptychographic\nImplicit Neural Representation (PtyINR), a self-supervised framework that\nsimultaneously addresses the object and probe recovery problem. By\nparameterizing both as continuous neural representations, PtyINR performs\nend-to-end reconstruction directly from raw diffraction patterns without\nrequiring any pre-characterization of the probe. Extensive evaluations\ndemonstrate that PtyINR achieves superior reconstruction quality on both\nsimulated and experimental data, with remarkable robustness under challenging\nlow-signal conditions. Furthermore, PtyINR offers a generalizable,\nphysics-informed framework for addressing probe-dependent inverse problems,\nmaking it applicable to a wide range of computational microscopy problems.",

To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel\nmulti-instance learning framework called MICACL, which integrates\nspatio-temporal dependency modeling and long-tailed contrastive learning\noptimization.

To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced\nRaven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for\nevaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,\nwith a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,\npattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers\non solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract\nreasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a\n``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete\ncausal chain in RPM tasks: image $\\rightarrow$ abstract attributes\n$\\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\\rightarrow$ pattern consistency\n$\\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture\nof the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the\noptimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational\nlower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,\nfails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning\nlogic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound\nsignificantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and\nmutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal\nrelationship between subjects and objects.

Previous\nstudies have mainly focused on features from single-view images, which can\ncause view bias and issues like pose variation, viewpoint changes, and\nocclusions. Using multi-view features to present a person can help reduce view\nbias.

Existing defense methods show\nthat such vision attacks are sensitive to image modifications especially\ncropping, using majority voting across responses of modified images as\ncorrected responses. However, these modifications often result in partial\nimages and distort the semantics, which reduces response quality on clean\nimages after voting. Instead of directly using responses from partial images\nfor voting, we investigate using them to supervise the LVLM's responses to the\noriginal images. We propose a black-box, training-free method called DPS\n(Defense through Partial-Perception Supervision). In this approach, the model\nis prompted using the responses generated by a model that perceives only a\npartial image. With DPS, the model can adjust its response based on partial\nimage understanding when under attack, while confidently maintaining its\noriginal response for clean input. Our findings show that the weak model can\nsupervise the strong model: when faced with an attacked input, the strong model\nbecomes less confident and adjusts its response based on the weak model's\npartial understanding, effectively defending against the attack. With clean\ninput, it confidently maintains its original response. Empirical experiments\nshow our method outperforms the baseline, cutting the average attack success\nrate by 76.3% across six datasets on three popular models.",

    "summary": "Multiview video is a key data source for volumetric video, enabling immersive\n3D scene reconstruction but posing significant challenges in storage and\ntransmission due to its massive data volume. Recently, deep learning-based\nend-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on\nsingle-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios\nunderexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding\n(LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while\nenhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively\nleveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance\ndependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion\ncorrelation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction\nmethod that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded\nindependent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model\nthat learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content\ncorrelation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module\nthat predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content\nfeatures, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures\ninter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC\nframework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC\nstandard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research\nin this field.",

    "summary": "Smartphones have become indispensable in people's daily lives, permeating\nnearly every aspect of modern society. With the continuous advancement of large\nlanguage models (LLMs), numerous LLM-based mobile agents have emerged. These\nagents are capable of accurately parsing diverse user queries and automatically\nassisting users in completing complex or repetitive operations. However,\ncurrent agents 1) heavily rely on the comprehension ability of LLMs, which can\nlead to errors caused by misoperations or omitted steps during tasks, 2) lack\ninteraction with the external environment, often terminating tasks when an app\ncannot fulfill user queries, and 3) lack memory capabilities, requiring each\ninstruction to reconstruct the interface and being unable to learn from and\ncorrect previous mistakes. To alleviate the above issues, we propose MobileRAG,\na mobile agents framework enhanced by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG),\nwhich includes InterRAG, LocalRAG, and MemRAG. It leverages RAG to more quickly\nand accurately identify user queries and accomplish complex and long-sequence\nmobile tasks. Additionally, to more comprehensively assess the performance of\nMobileRAG, we introduce MobileRAG-Eval, a more challenging benchmark\ncharacterized by numerous complex, real-world mobile tasks that require\nexternal knowledge assistance. Extensive experimental results on MobileRAG-Eval\ndemonstrate that MobileRAG can easily handle real-world mobile tasks, achieving\n10.3\\% improvement over state-of-the-art methods with fewer operational steps.\nOur code is publicly available at:\nhttps://github.com/liuxiaojieOutOfWorld/MobileRAG_arxiv",

    "summary": "Existing LLM agent systems typically select actions from a fixed and\npredefined set at every step. While this approach is effective in closed,\nnarrowly scoped environments, it presents two major challenges for real-world,\nopen-ended scenarios: (1) it significantly restricts the planning and acting\ncapabilities of LLM agents, and (2) it requires substantial human effort to\nenumerate and implement all possible actions, which is impractical in complex\nenvironments with a vast number of potential actions. To address these\nlimitations, we propose an LLM agent framework that can dynamically create and\ncompose actions as needed. In this framework, the agent interacts with its\nenvironment by generating and executing programs written in a general-purpose\nprogramming language. Moreover, generated actions are accumulated over time for\nfuture reuse. Our extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that\nthis framework significantly improves flexibility and outperforms prior methods\nthat rely on a fixed action set. Notably, it enables LLM agents to adapt and\nrecover in scenarios where predefined actions are insufficient or fail due to\nunforeseen edge cases.

To\novercome these difficulties, we propose Distillation-Guided Policy Optimization\n(DGPO), which addresses the challenges through cold-start initialization from\nteacher demonstrations and continuous teacher guidance during policy\noptimization. To systematically evaluate our approach, we introduce Agentic RAG\nCapabilities (ARC), a fine-grained metric analyzing reasoning, search\ncoordination, and response synthesis.

This paradigm enables models to generate intermediate\nreasoning steps, thereby improving both accuracy and interpretability. However,\ndespite these advancements, a comprehensive understanding of how CoT-based\nreasoning affects the trustworthiness of language models remains\nunderdeveloped. In this paper, we survey recent work on reasoning models and\nCoT techniques, focusing on five core dimensions of trustworthy reasoning:\ntruthfulness, safety, robustness, fairness, and privacy. For each aspect, we\nprovide a clear and structured overview of recent studies in chronological\norder, along with detailed analyses of their methodologies, findings, and\nlimitations. Future research directions are also appended at the end for\nreference and discussion. Overall, while reasoning techniques hold promise for\nenhancing model trustworthiness through hallucination mitigation, harmful\ncontent detection, and robustness improvement, cutting-edge reasoning models\nthemselves often suffer from comparable or even greater vulnerabilities in\nsafety, robustness, and privacy.

    "title": "SiLVERScore: Semantically-Aware Embeddings for Sign Language Generation   Evaluation",
    "summary": "Evaluating sign language generation is often done through back-translation,\nwhere generated signs are first recognized back to text and then compared to a\nreference using text-based metrics. However, this two-step evaluation pipeline\nintroduces ambiguity: it not only fails to capture the multimodal nature of\nsign language-such as facial expressions, spatial grammar, and prosody-but also\nmakes it hard to pinpoint whether evaluation errors come from sign generation\nmodel or the translation system used to assess it. In this work, we propose\nSiLVERScore, a novel semantically-aware embedding-based evaluation metric that\nassesses sign language generation in a joint embedding space. Our contributions\ninclude: (1) identifying limitations of existing metrics, (2) introducing\nSiLVERScore for semantically-aware evaluation, (3) demonstrating its robustness\nto semantic and prosodic variations, and (4) exploring generalization\nchallenges across datasets. On PHOENIX-14T and CSL-Daily datasets, SiLVERScore\nachieves near-perfect discrimination between correct and random pairs (ROC AUC\n= 0.99, overlap < 7%), substantially outperforming traditional metrics.",

    "summary": "We study the problem of sampling from a distribution $\\mu$ with density\n$\\propto e^{-V}$ for some potential function $V:\\mathbb R^d\\to \\mathbb R$ with\nquery access to $V$ and $\\nabla V$. We start with the following standard\nassumptions:\n  (1) The potential function $V$ is $L$-smooth.\n  (2) The second moment $\\mathbf{E}_{X\\sim \\mu}[\\|X\\|^2]\\leq M$.\n  Recently, He and Zhang (COLT'25) showed that the query complexity of sampling\nfrom such distributions is at least\n$\\left(\\frac{LM}{d\\epsilon}\\right)^{\\Omega(d)}$ where $\\epsilon$ is the desired\naccuracy in total variation distance, and the Poincar\\'e constant can be\narbitrarily large.\n  Meanwhile, another common assumption in the study of diffusion based samplers\n(see e.g., the work of Chen, Chewi, Li, Li, Salim and Zhang (ICLR'23))\nstrengthens the smoothness condition (1) to the following:\n  (1*) The potential function of *every* distribution along the\nOrnstein-Uhlenbeck process starting from $\\mu$ is $L$-smooth.\n  We show that under the assumptions (1*) and (2), the query complexity of\nsampling from $\\mu$ can be $\\mathrm{poly}(L,d)\\cdot\n\\left(\\frac{Ld+M}{\\epsilon^2}\\right)^{\\mathcal{O}(L+1)}$, which is polynomial\nin $d$ and $\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$ when $L=\\mathcal{O}(1)$ and\n$M=\\mathrm{poly}(d)$. This improves the algorithm with quasi-polynomial query\ncomplexity developed by Huang et al. (COLT'24). Our results imply that the\nseemly moderate strengthening of the smoothness condition (1) to (1*) can lead\nto an exponential gap in the query complexity of sampling algorithms.\n  Moreover, we show that together with the assumption (1*) and the stronger\nmoment assumption that $\\|X\\|$ is $\\lambda$-sub-Gaussian for $X\\sim\\mu$, the\nPoincar\\'e constant of $\\mu$ is at most $\\mathcal{O}(\\lambda)^{2(L+1)}$.

    "title": "Towards understanding Accelerated Stein Variational Gradient Flow --   Analysis of Generalized Bilinear Kernels for Gaussian target distributions",
    "summary": "Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) is a kernel-based and\nnon-parametric particle method for sampling from a target distribution, such as\nin Bayesian inference and other machine learning tasks. Different from other\nparticle methods, SVGD does not require estimating the score, which is the\ngradient of the log-density. However, in practice, SVGD can be slow compared to\nscore-estimation-based sampling algorithms. To design a fast and efficient\nhigh-dimensional sampling algorithm with the advantages of SVGD, we introduce\naccelerated SVGD (ASVGD), based on an accelerated gradient flow in a metric\nspace of probability densities following Nesterov's method. We then derive a\nmomentum-based discrete-time sampling algorithm, which evolves a set of\nparticles deterministically. To stabilize the particles' position update, we\nalso include a Wasserstein metric regularization. This paper extends the\nconference version \\cite{SL2025}. For the bilinear kernel and Gaussian target\ndistributions, we study the kernel parameter and damping parameters with an\noptimal convergence rate of the proposed dynamics. This is achieved by\nanalyzing the linearized accelerated gradient flows at the equilibrium.\nInterestingly, the optimal parameter is a constant, which does not depend on\nthe covariance of the target distribution. For the generalized kernel\nfunctions, such as the Gaussian kernel, numerical examples with varied target\ndistributions demonstrate the effectiveness of ASVGD compared to SVGD and other\npopular sampling methods. Furthermore, we show that in the setting of Bayesian\nneural networks, ASVGD outperforms SVGD significantly in terms of\nlog-likelihood and total iteration times.",

Table tennis\nexemplifies such a challenge: with ball speeds exceeding 5 m/s, players must\nperceive, predict, and act within sub-second reaction times, requiring both\nagility and precision. To address this, we present a hierarchical framework for\nhumanoid table tennis that integrates a model-based planner for ball trajectory\nprediction and racket target planning with a reinforcement learning-based\nwhole-body controller. The planner determines striking position, velocity and\ntiming, while the controller generates coordinated arm and leg motions that\nmimic human strikes and maintain stability and agility across consecutive\nrallies. Moreover, to encourage natural movements, human motion references are\nincorporated during training. We validate our system on a general-purpose\nhumanoid robot, achieving up to 106 consecutive shots with a human opponent and\nsustained exchanges against another humanoid. These results demonstrate\nreal-world humanoid table tennis with sub-second reactive control, marking a\nstep toward agile and interactive humanoid behaviors.",

    "summary": "Vision-based tactile sensors (VBTS) have gained widespread application in\nrobotic hands, grippers and prosthetics due to their high spatial resolution,\nlow manufacturing costs, and ease of customization. While VBTSs have common\ndesign features, such as a camera module, they can differ in a rich diversity\nof sensing principles, material compositions, multimodal approaches, and data\ninterpretation methods. Here, we propose a novel classification of VBTS that\ncategorizes the technology into two primary sensing principles based on the\nunderlying transduction of contact into a tactile image: the Marker-Based\nTransduction Principle and the Intensity-Based Transduction Principle.\nMarker-Based Transduction interprets tactile information by detecting marker\ndisplacement and changes in marker density. In contrast, Intensity-Based\nTransduction maps external disturbances with variations in pixel values.\nDepending on the design of the contact module, Marker-Based Transduction can be\nfurther divided into two subtypes: Simple Marker-Based (SMB) and Morphological\nMarker-Based (MMB) mechanisms. Similarly, the Intensity-Based Transduction\nPrinciple encompasses the Reflective Layer-based (RLB) and Transparent\nLayer-Based (TLB) mechanisms. This paper provides a comparative study of the\nhardware characteristics of these four types of sensors including various\ncombination types, and discusses the commonly used methods for interpreting\ntactile information.

However,\ntraditional perception-planning pipelines often fall short in open-ended tasks\ndue to limited flexibility, while the architecture of a single end-to-end\nVision-Language-Action (VLA) offers promising capabilities but lacks crucial\nmechanisms for anticipating and recovering from failure. To address these\nchallenges, we propose FPC-VLA, a dual-model framework that integrates VLA with\na supervisor for failure prediction and correction. The supervisor evaluates\naction viability through vision-language queries and generates corrective\nstrategies when risks arise, trained efficiently without manual labeling.

The pose\nestimator is a critical component of wall climbing mobile robots, as their\noperational environment involves carrying precise measurement equipment and\nmaintenance tools in construction, requiring information about pose on the\nbuilding at the time of measurement. Due to the complex geometry and material\nproperties of building facades, the use of traditional localization sensors\nsuch as laser, ultrasonic, or radar is often infeasible for wall-climbing\nrobots. Moreover, GPS-based localization is generally unreliable in these\nenvironments because of signal degradation caused by reinforced concrete and\nelectromagnetic interference. Consequently, robot odometry remains the primary\nsource of velocity and position information, despite being susceptible to drift\ncaused by both systematic and non-systematic errors. The calibrations of the\nrobot's systematic parameters were conducted using nonlinear optimization and\nLevenberg-Marquardt methods as Newton-Gauss and gradient-based model fitting\nmethods, while Genetic algorithm and Particle swarm were used as\nstochastic-based methods for kinematic parameter calibration. Performance and\nresults of the calibration methods and pose estimators were validated in detail\nwith experiments on the experimental mobile wall climbing robot.",

We conducted an online vignette experiment, complemented\nby qualitative data on participants' feelings and justifications after\n(counter-)normative behavior. In line with the theory, counter-normative\nchoices elicited higher regret than norm-adherent choices. On average, choosing\nAI increased regret compared to choosing an human. This aversion was weaker\nwhen AI use was presented as the prevailing norm, indicating a statistically\nsignificant interaction between AI use and an AI-favoring norm. Participants\nalso attributed less blame to technology than to humans, which increased regret\nwhen AI was chosen over human expertise.

We feed a high-resolution\nrange profile to the deep learning model that can analyze the motions of\nmultiple body parts and predict the 3D positions of 21 finger joints, bringing\nthe granularity for acoustic hand tracking to the next level. It operates\nacross different environments and users without the need for personalized\ntraining data. A user study with 11 participants in 3 different environments\nshows that Beyond-Voice can track joints with an average mean absolute error of\n16.47mm without any training data provided by the testing subject.",

    "title": "Towards an Understanding of Developer Experience-Driven Transparency in   Software Ecosystems",
    "summary": "Software ecosystems (SECO) have become a dominant paradigm in the software\nindustry, enabling third-party developers to co-create value through\ncomplementary components and services. While Developer Experience (DX) is\nincreasingly recognized as critical for sustainable SECO, transparency remains\nan underexplored factor shaping how developers perceive and interact with\necosystems. Existing studies acknowledge transparency as essential for trust,\nfairness, and engagement, yet its relationship with DX has not been\nsystematically conceptualized. Hence, this work aims to advance the\nunderstanding of transparency in SECO from a developer-centered perspective. To\nthis end, we propose SECO-TransDX (Transparency in Software Ecosystems from a\nDeveloper Experience Perspective), a conceptual model that introduces the\nnotion of DX-driven transparency. The model identifies 63 interrelated\nconcepts, including conditioning factors, ecosystem procedures, artifacts, and\nrelational dynamics that influence how transparency is perceived and\nconstructed during developer interactions. SECO-TransDX was built upon prior\nresearch and refined through a Delphi study with experts from academia and\nindustry. It offers a structured lens to examine how transparency mediates DX\nacross technical, social, and organizational layers. For researchers, it lays\nthe groundwork for future studies and tool development; for practitioners, it\nsupports the design of trustworthy, developer-centered platforms that improve\ntransparency and foster long-term engagement in SECO.",

Nevertheless, the lack of focus on the needs of these stakeholders\nresults in their limited acceptance and skepticism toward automating the whole\nfact-checking process. In this study, we conducted semi-structured in-depth\ninterviews with Central European fact-checkers. Their activities and problems\nwere analyzed using iterative content analysis. The most significant problems\nwere validated with a survey of European fact-checkers, in which we collected\n24 responses from 20 countries, i.e., 62% of active European signatories of the\nInternational Fact-Checking Network (IFCN). Our contributions include an\nin-depth examination of the variability of fact-checking work in\nnon-English-speaking regions, which still remained largely uncovered. By\naligning them with the knowledge from prior studies, we created conceptual\nmodels that help to understand the fact-checking processes. In addition, we\nmapped our findings on the fact-checkers' activities and needs to the relevant\ntasks for AI research, while providing a discussion on three AI tasks that were\nnot covered by previous similar studies.

    "summary": "A Markov logic network (MLN) determines a probability distribution on the set\nof structures, or ``possible worlds'', with an arbitrary finite domain. We\nstudy the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to\ninfinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the\nproperties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be\nstudied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one\nrelation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete\ncharacterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An\nMLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer\nk-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''\nfor first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer\nvertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis\nshows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit\nbehaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the\nsoft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It\nwill also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted\nBayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly\nmeaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with\nincreasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not\neven approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown\nthat on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost\nall its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible\nworlds than the uniform distribution does.",

If artificial general\nintelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason,\nproblem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will\nincreasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise\na natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans,\na successor \"digital species\", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of\nthe universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked\ndifferentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central\nnervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical\nreality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain,\njoy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of\nour actions on the world around us.

A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a\nbiological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be\nsufficient to make AI systems superior to humans.

    "summary": "Recent progress in text-to-music generation has enabled models to synthesize\nhigh-quality musical segments, full compositions, and even respond to\nfine-grained control signals, e.g. chord progressions. State-of-the-art (SOTA)\nsystems differ significantly in many dimensions, such as training datasets,\nmodeling paradigms, and architectural choices. This diversity complicates\nefforts to evaluate models fairly and identify which design choices influence\nperformance the most. While factors like data and architecture are important,\nin this study we focus exclusively on the modeling paradigm. We conduct a\nsystematic empirical analysis to isolate its effects, offering insights into\nassociated trade-offs and emergent behaviors that can guide future\ntext-to-music generation systems. Specifically, we compare the two arguably\nmost common modeling paradigms: auto-regressive decoding and conditional\nflow-matching. We conduct a controlled comparison by training all models from\nscratch using identical datasets, training configurations, and similar backbone\narchitectures. Performance is evaluated across multiple axes, including\ngeneration quality, robustness to inference configurations, scalability,\nadherence to both textual and temporally aligned conditioning, and editing\ncapabilities in the form of audio inpainting. This comparative study sheds\nlight on distinct strengths and limitations of each paradigm, providing\nactionable insights that can inform future architectural and training decisions\nin the evolving landscape of text-to-music generation.

    "summary": "This paper explores the application of enhancement filtering techniques in\nneural video compression. Specifically, we categorize these techniques into\nin-loop contextual filtering and out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement based\non whether the enhanced representation affects the subsequent coding loop.\nIn-loop contextual filtering refines the temporal context by mitigating error\npropagation during frame-by-frame encoding. However, its influence on both the\ncurrent and subsequent frames poses challenges in adaptively applying filtering\nthroughout the sequence. To address this, we introduce an adaptive coding\ndecision strategy that dynamically determines filtering application during\nencoding. Additionally, out-of-loop reconstruction enhancement is employed to\nrefine the quality of reconstructed frames, providing a simple yet effective\nimprovement in coding efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, this work\npresents the first systematic study of enhancement filtering in the context of\nconditional-based neural video compression. Extensive experiments demonstrate a\n7.71% reduction in bit rate compared to state-of-the-art neural video codecs,\nvalidating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

    "title": "Structure Transfer: an Inference-Based Calculus for the Transformation   of Representations",
    "summary": "Representation choice is of fundamental importance to our ability to\ncommunicate and reason effectively. A major unsolved problem, addressed in this\npaper, is how to devise representational-system (RS) agnostic techniques that\ndrive representation transformation and choice. We present a novel calculus,\ncalled structure transfer, that enables representation transformation across\ndiverse RSs. Specifically, given a source representation drawn from a source\nRS, the rules of structure transfer allow us to generate a target\nrepresentation for a target RS. The generality of structure transfer comes in\npart from its ability to ensure that the source representation and the\ngenerated target representation satisfy any specified relation (such as\nsemantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting schemas, which encode\nknowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can express preservation of\ninformation across relations between any pair of RSs, and this knowledge is\nused by structure transfer to derive a structure for the target representation\nwhich ensures that the desired relation holds. We formalise this using\nRepresentational Systems Theory, building on the key concept of a construction\nspace. The abstract nature of construction spaces grants them the generality to\nmodel RSs of diverse kinds, including formal languages, geometric figures and\ndiagrams, as well as informal notations. Consequently, structure transfer is a\nsystem-agnostic calculus that can be used to identify alternative\nrepresentations in a wide range of practical settings.",

    "summary": "Recent AI work trends towards incorporating human-centric objectives, with\nthe explicit goal of aligning AI models to personal preferences and societal\nvalues. Using standard preference elicitation methods, researchers and\npractitioners build models of human decisions and judgments, which are then\nused to align AI behavior with that of humans. However, models commonly used in\nsuch elicitation processes often do not capture the true cognitive processes of\nhuman decision making, such as when people use heuristics to simplify\ninformation associated with a decision problem. As a result, models learned\nfrom people's decisions often do not align with their cognitive processes, and\ncan not be used to validate the learning framework for generalization to other\ndecision-making tasks. To address this limitation, we take an axiomatic\napproach to learning cognitively faithful decision processes from pairwise\ncomparisons. Building on the vast literature characterizing the cognitive\nprocesses that contribute to human decision-making, and recent work\ncharacterizing such processes in pairwise comparison tasks, we define a class\nof models in which individual features are first processed and compared across\nalternatives, and then the processed features are then aggregated via a fixed\nrule, such as the Bradley-Terry rule. This structured processing of information\nensures such models are realistic and feasible candidates to represent\nunderlying human decision-making processes. We demonstrate the efficacy of this\nmodeling approach in learning interpretable models of human decision making in\na kidney allocation task, and show that our proposed models match or surpass\nthe accuracy of prior models of human pairwise decision-making.",

Second, we develop two complementary mappings: (i) small-signal\nlinearizations that yield locally valid LTI SSMs with interpretable poles and\nmemory horizons; and (ii) lifted/Koopman random-feature expansions that render\nthe ESN a linear SSM in an augmented state, enabling transfer-function and\nconvolutional-kernel analyses. This perspective yields frequency-domain\ncharacterizations of memory spectra and clarifies when ESNs emulate structured\nSSM kernels.

However, existing methods lack causal\nawareness, with insufficient modeling of heterogeneity, confounding, and\nobservational constraints, leading to poor interpretability and difficulty\ndistinguishing true causal heterogeneity from spurious associations. We propose\nan unsupervised framework, HCL (Interpretable Causal Mechanism-Aware Clustering\nwith Adaptive Heterogeneous Causal Structure Learning), that jointly infers\nlatent clusters and their associated causal structures from mixed-type\nobservational data without requiring temporal ordering, environment labels,\ninterventions or other prior knowledge. HCL relaxes the homogeneity and\nsufficiency assumptions by introducing an equivalent representation that\nencodes both structural heterogeneity and confounding. It further develops a\nbi-directional iterative strategy to alternately refine causal clustering and\nstructure learning, along with a self-supervised regularization that balance\ncross-cluster universality and specificity. Together, these components enable\nconvergence toward interpretable, heterogeneous causal patterns. Theoretically,\nwe show identifiability of heterogeneous causal structures under mild\nconditions. Empirically, HCL achieves superior performance in both clustering\nand structure learning tasks, and recovers biologically meaningful mechanisms\nin real-world single-cell perturbation data, demonstrating its utility for\ndiscovering interpretable, mechanism-level causal heterogeneity.",

Each agent independently\nlearns its closed-loop behavior from experimental data by solving convex\nsemidefinite programs that generate locally invariant ellipsoids and\ncorresponding state-feedback gains. These ellipsoids, centered along grid-based\nwaypoints, certify the dynamic feasibility of short-range transitions and\ndefine safe regions of operation. A sampling-based planner constructs a tree of\nsuch waypoints, where transitions are allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids\noverlap, ensuring invariant-to-invariant transitions and continuous safety. All\nagents expand their trees simultaneously and are coordinated through a\nspace-time reservation table that guarantees inter-agent safety by preventing\nsimultaneous occupancy and head-on collisions. Each successful edge in the tree\nis equipped with its own local controller, enabling execution without\nre-solving optimization problems at runtime. The resulting trajectories are not\nonly dynamically feasible but also provably safe with respect to both\nenvironmental constraints and inter-agent collisions.

As machine learning\nmodels and the optimisation capacity to train them grow, growing empirical\nevidence reinforced the belief in the validity of this law without however\nbeing formalised. Recently, a few attempts were made to formalise Goodhart's\nlaw, either by categorising variants of it, or by looking at how optimising a\nproxy metric affects the optimisation of an intended goal. In this work, we\nalleviate the simplifying independence assumption, made in previous works, and\nthe assumption on the learning paradigm made in most of them, to study the\neffect of the coupling between the proxy metric and the intended goal on\nGoodhart's law. Our results show that in the case of light tailed goal and\nlight tailed discrepancy, dependence does not change the nature of Goodhart's\neffect. However, in the light tailed goal and heavy tailed discrepancy case, we\nexhibit an example where over-optimisation occurs at a rate inversely\nproportional to the heavy tailedness of the discrepancy between the goal and\nthe metric. %",

    "summary": "Although real-world decision-making problems can often be encoded as causal\nmulti-armed bandits (CMABs) at different levels of abstraction, a general\nmethodology exploiting the information and computational advantages of each\nabstraction level is missing. In this paper, we propose AT-UCB, an algorithm\nwhich efficiently exploits shared information between CMAB problem instances\ndefined at different levels of abstraction. More specifically, AT-UCB leverages\ncausal abstraction (CA) theory to explore within a cheap-to-simulate and\ncoarse-grained CMAB instance, before employing the traditional upper confidence\nbound (UCB) algorithm on a restricted set of potentially optimal actions in the\nCMAB of interest, leading to significant reductions in cumulative regret when\ncompared to the classical UCB algorithm. We illustrate the advantages of AT-UCB\ntheoretically, through a novel upper bound on the cumulative regret, and\nempirically, by applying AT-UCB to epidemiological simulators with varying\nresolution and computational cost.",

    "summary": "Since any ReLU network is piecewise affine, its hidden units can be\ncharacterized by their pullbacks through the active subnetwork, i.e., by their\ngradients (up to bias terms). However, gradients of deeper neurons are\nnotoriously misaligned, which obscures the network's internal representations.\nWe posit that models do align gradients with data, yet this is concealed by the\nintrinsic noise of the ReLU hard gating. We validate this intuition by applying\nsoft gating in the backward pass only, reducing the local impact of weakly\nexcited neurons. The resulting modified gradients, which we call \"excitation\npullbacks\", exhibit striking perceptual alignment on a number of\nImageNet-pretrained architectures, while the rudimentary pixel-space gradient\nascent quickly produces easily interpretable input- and target-specific\nfeatures. Inspired by these findings, we formulate the \"path stability\"\nhypothesis, claiming that the binary activation patterns largely stabilize\nduring training and get encoded in the pre-activation distribution of the final\nmodel. When true, excitation pullbacks become aligned with the gradients of a\nkernel machine that mainly determines the network's decision. This provides a\ntheoretical justification for the apparent faithfulness of the feature\nattributions based on these pullbacks, potentially even leading to mechanistic\ninterpretability of deeper models. Incidentally, we give a possible explanation\nfor the effectiveness of Batch Normalization and Deep Features, together with a\nnovel perspective on the network's internal memory and generalization\nproperties. We release the code and an interactive app for easier exploration\nof the excitation pullbacks.",

    "summary": "Graph representation learning has become a mainstream method for fraud\ndetection due to its strong expressive power, which focuses on enhancing node\nrepresentations through improved neighborhood knowledge capture. However, the\nfocus on local interactions leads to imbalanced transmission of global\ntopological information and increased risk of node-specific information being\noverwhelmed during aggregation due to the imbalance between fraud and benign\nnodes. In this paper, we first summarize the impact of topology and class\nimbalance on downstream tasks in GNN-based fraud detection, as the problem of\nimbalanced supervisory messages is caused by fraudsters' topological behavior\nobfuscation and identity feature concealment. Based on statistical validation,\nwe propose a novel dual-view graph representation learning method to mitigate\nMessage imbalance in Fraud Detection (MimbFD). Specifically, we design a\ntopological message reachability module for high-quality node representation\nlearning to penetrate fraudsters' camouflage and alleviate insufficient\npropagation. Then, we introduce a local confounding debiasing module to adjust\nnode representations, enhancing the stable association between node\nrepresentations and labels to balance the influence of different classes.\nFinally, we conducted experiments on three public fraud datasets, and the\nresults demonstrate that MimbFD exhibits outstanding performance in fraud\ndetection.",

    "summary": "Despite the success of adaptive time-stepping in ODE simulation, it has so\nfar seen few applications for Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs). To\nsimulate SDEs adaptively, methods such as the Virtual Brownian Tree (VBT) have\nbeen developed, which can generate Brownian motion (BM) non-chronologically.\nHowever, in most applications, knowing only the values of Brownian motion is\nnot enough to achieve a high order of convergence; for that, we must compute\ntime-integrals of BM such as $\\int_s^t W_r \\, dr$. With the aim of using high\norder SDE solvers adaptively, we extend the VBT to generate these integrals of\nBM in addition to the Brownian increments. A JAX-based implementation of our\nconstruction is included in the popular Diffrax library\n(https://github.com/patrick-kidger/diffrax).\n  Since the entire Brownian path produced by VBT is uniquely determined by a\nsingle PRNG seed, previously generated samples need not be stored, which\nresults in a constant memory footprint and enables experiment repeatability and\nstrong error estimation. Based on binary search, the VBT's time complexity is\nlogarithmic in the tolerance parameter $\\varepsilon$. Unlike the original VBT\nalgorithm, which was only precise at some dyadic times, we prove that our\nconstruction exactly matches the joint distribution of the Brownian motion and\nits time integrals at any query times, provided they are at least $\\varepsilon$\napart.\n  We present two applications of adaptive high order solvers enabled by our new\nVBT. Using adaptive solvers to simulate a high-volatility CIR model, we achieve\nmore than twice the convergence order of constant stepping. We apply an\nadaptive third order underdamped or kinetic Langevin solver to an MCMC problem,\nwhere our approach outperforms the No U-Turn Sampler, while using only a tenth\nof its function evaluations.",

    "summary": "The flexibility of a power generation unit determines how quickly and often\nit can ramp up or down. In energy models, it depends on assumptions on the\ntechnical characteristics of the unit, such as its installed capacity or\nturbine technology. In this paper, we learn the empirical flexibility of gas\nunits from their electricity generation, revealing how real-world limitations\ncan lead to substantial differences between units with similar technical\ncharacteristics. Using a novel deep clustering approach, we transform 5 years\n(2019-2023) of unit-level hourly generation data for 49 German units from 100\nMWp of installed capacity into low-dimensional embeddings. Our unsupervised\napproach identifies two clusters of peaker units (high flexibility) and two\nclusters of non-peaker units (low flexibility). The estimated ramp rates of\nnon-peakers, which constitute half of the sample, display a low empirical\nflexibility, comparable to coal units. Non-peakers, predominantly owned by\nindustry and municipal utilities, show limited response to low residual load\nand negative prices, generating on average 1.3 GWh during those hours. As the\ntransition to renewables increases market variability, regulatory changes will\nbe needed to unlock this flexibility potential.",

We introduce two supervised metrics, precision and\nrecall, to evaluate the relationship phase.

Here, such\nbehavior changes are typically associated with the Proteus effect or bodily\naffordances elicited by different avatars that the users embody in XR. We\npresent a biometric user model based on deep metric similarity learning, which\nuses high-dimensional embeddings as reference vectors to identify behavior\nchanges of individual users. We evaluate our model against two alternative\napproaches: a (non-learned) motion analysis based on central tendencies of\nmovement patterns and subjective post-exposure embodiment questionnaires\nfrequently used in various XR exposures. In a within-subject study,\nparticipants performed a fruit collection task while embodying avatars of\ndifferent body heights (short, actual-height, and tall).

This work addresses this\nthreat by introducing a simple, training-free, yet effective approach for\ndetecting AI-generated speech and attributing it to its source model.\nSpecifically, we tackle three key tasks: (1) single-model attribution in an\nopen-world setting, where the goal is to determine whether a given audio sample\nwas generated by a specific target neural speech synthesis system (with access\nonly to data from that system); (2) multi-model attribution in a closed-world\nsetting, where the objective is to identify the generating system from a known\npool of candidates; and last but not least (3) detection of synthetic versus\nreal speech. Our approach leverages standardized average residuals-the\ndifference between an input audio signal and its filtered version using either\na low-pass filter or the EnCodec audio autoencoder. We demonstrate that these\nresiduals consistently capture artifacts introduced by diverse speech synthesis\nsystems, serving as distinctive, model-agnostic fingerprints for attribution.\nAcross extensive experiments, our approach achieves AUROC scores exceeding 99%\nin most scenarios, evaluated on augmented benchmark datasets that pair real\nspeech with synthetic audio generated by multiple synthesis systems. In\naddition, our robustness analysis underscores the method's ability to maintain\nhigh performance even in the presence of moderate additive noise.

We\nconnect the linear assignment problem to Monge's transport problem,\nKantorovich's relaxation, and Wasserstein distances, then extend to cases where\nsource and target lie in different metric-measure spaces requiring\nGromov-Wasserstein (GW) distances. GW formulations, including the fused GW\nvariant that integrates structural and feature information, naturally address\nQAP-like problems by optimizing alignment based on both intra-domain distances\nand cross-domain attributes. Applications include graph matching, keypoint\ncorrespondence, and feature-based assignments. We present exact solvers,\nGenetic Algorithms (GA), and multiple GW variants, including a proposed\nmulti-initialization strategy (GW-MultiInit) that mitigates the risk of getting\nstuck in local optima alongside entropic Sinkhorn-based approximations and\nfused GW. Computational experiments on capacitated QAP instances show that\nGW-MultiInit consistently achieves near-optimal solutions and scales\nefficiently to large problems where exact methods become impractical, while\nparameterized EGW and FGW variants provide flexible trade-offs between accuracy\nand runtime. Our findings provide theoretical foundations, computational\ninsights, and practical guidelines for applying OT and GW methods to QAP and\nother real-world matching problems, such as those in machine learning and\nlogistics.",

    "summary": "Employing a single, unified model (UM) for both visual understanding\n(image-to-text: I2T) and and visual generation (text-to-image: T2I) has opened\na new direction in Visual Language Model (VLM) research. While UMs can also\nsupport broader unimodal tasks (e.g., text-to-text, image-to-image), we focus\non the core cross-modal pair T2I and I2T, as consistency between understanding\nand generation is critical for downstream use. Existing evaluations consider\nthese capabilities in isolation: FID and GenEval for T2I, and benchmarks such\nas MME, MMBench for I2T. These single-pass metrics do not reveal whether a\nmodel that understands a concept can also render it, nor whether meaning is\npreserved when cycling between image and text modalities. To address this, we\nintroduce the Unified Consistency Framework for Unified Models (UCF-UM), a\ncyclic evaluation protocol that alternates I2T and T2I over multiple\ngenerations to quantify semantic drift. UCF formulates 3 metrics: (i) Mean\nCumulative Drift (MCD), an embedding-based measure of overall semantic loss;\n(ii) Semantic Drift Rate (SDR), that summarizes semantic decay rate; and (iii)\nMulti-Generation GenEval (MGG), an object-level compliance score extending\nGenEval. To assess generalization beyond COCO, which is widely used in\ntraining; we create a new benchmark ND400, sampled from NoCaps and DOCCI and\nevaluate on seven recent models. UCF-UM reveals substantial variation in\ncross-modal stability: some models like BAGEL maintain semantics over many\nalternations, whereas others like Vila-u drift quickly despite strong\nsingle-pass scores. Our results highlight cyclic consistency as a necessary\ncomplement to standard I2T and T2I evaluations, and provide practical metrics\nto consistently assess unified model's cross-modal stability and strength of\ntheir shared representations.

    "summary": "With advancements in satellite imaging technology, acquiring high-resolution\nmulti-view satellite imagery has become increasingly accessible, enabling rapid\nand location-independent ground model reconstruction. However, traditional\nstereo matching methods struggle to capture fine details, and while neural\nradiance fields (NeRFs) achieve high-quality reconstructions, their training\ntime is prohibitively long. Moreover, challenges such as low visibility of\nbuilding facades, illumination and style differences between pixels, and weakly\ntextured regions in satellite imagery further make it hard to reconstruct\nreasonable terrain geometry and detailed building facades. To address these\nissues, we propose Sat-DN, a novel framework leveraging a progressively trained\nmulti-resolution hash grid reconstruction architecture with explicit depth\nguidance and surface normal consistency constraints to enhance reconstruction\nquality. The multi-resolution hash grid accelerates training, while the\nprogressive strategy incrementally increases the learning frequency, using\ncoarse low-frequency geometry to guide the reconstruction of fine\nhigh-frequency details. The depth and normal constraints ensure a clear\nbuilding outline and correct planar distribution.

    "summary": "Falling objects from buildings can cause severe injuries to pedestrians due\nto the great impact force they exert. Although surveillance cameras are\ninstalled around some buildings, it is challenging for humans to capture such\nevents in surveillance videos due to the small size and fast motion of falling\nobjects, as well as the complex background. Therefore, it is necessary to\ndevelop methods to automatically detect falling objects around buildings in\nsurveillance videos. To facilitate the investigation of falling object\ndetection, we propose a large, diverse video dataset called FADE (FAlling\nObject DEtection around Buildings) for the first time. FADE contains 1,881\nvideos from 18 scenes, featuring 8 falling object categories, 4 weather\nconditions, and 4 video resolutions. Additionally, we develop a new object\ndetection method called FADE-Net, which effectively leverages motion\ninformation and produces small-sized but high-quality proposals for detecting\nfalling objects around buildings. Importantly, our method is extensively\nevaluated and analyzed by comparing it with the previous approaches used for\ngeneric object detection, video object detection, and moving object detection\non the FADE dataset. Experimental results show that the proposed FADE-Net\nsignificantly outperforms other methods, providing an effective baseline for\nfuture research.

This design, dubbed global-to-local,\nstems from the computational cost of local matching approaches, which can only\nbe afforded for a small number of retrieved images. However, emerging efficient\nlocal feature search approaches have opened up new possibilities, in particular\nenabling detailed retrieval at large scale, to find partial matches which are\noften missed by global feature search. In parallel, global feature-based\nre-ranking has shown promising results with high computational efficiency.

Critically, we propose a re-ranking method where global\nfeatures are computed on-the-fly, based on the local feature retrieval\nsimilarities. Such re-ranking-only global features leverage multidimensional\nscaling techniques to create embeddings which respect the local similarities\nobtained during search, enabling a significant re-ranking boost.\nExperimentally, we demonstrate solid retrieval performance, setting new\nstate-of-the-art results on the Revisited Oxford and Paris datasets.",

    "summary": "Efficient perception models are essential for Advanced Driver Assistance\nSystems (ADAS), as these applications require rapid processing and response to\nensure safety and effectiveness in real-world environments. To address the\nreal-time execution needs of such perception models, this study introduces the\nTriLiteNet model. This model can simultaneously manage multiple tasks related\nto panoramic driving perception. TriLiteNet is designed to optimize performance\nwhile maintaining low computational costs. Experimental results on the BDD100k\ndataset demonstrate that the model achieves competitive performance across\nthree key tasks: vehicle detection, drivable area segmentation, and lane line\nsegmentation. Specifically, the TriLiteNet_{base} demonstrated a recall of\n85.6% for vehicle detection, a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 92.4% for\ndrivable area segmentation, and an Acc of 82.3% for lane line segmentation with\nonly 2.35M parameters and a computational cost of 7.72 GFLOPs. Our proposed\nmodel includes a tiny configuration with just 0.14M parameters, which provides\na multi-task solution with minimal computational demand. Evaluated for latency\nand power consumption on embedded devices, TriLiteNet in both configurations\nshows low latency and reasonable power during inference. By balancing\nperformance, computational efficiency, and scalability, TriLiteNet offers a\npractical and deployable solution for real-world autonomous driving\napplications.

    "title": "SPARE: Symmetrized Point-to-Plane Distance for Robust Non-Rigid   Registration",
    "summary": "Existing optimization-based methods for non-rigid registration typically\nminimize an alignment error metric based on the point-to-point or\npoint-to-plane distance between corresponding point pairs on the source surface\nand target surface. However, these metrics can result in slow convergence or a\nloss of detail. In this paper, we propose SPARE, a novel formulation that\nutilizes a symmetrized point-to-plane distance for robust non-rigid\nregistration. The symmetrized point-to-plane distance relies on both the\npositions and normals of the corresponding points, resulting in a more accurate\napproximation of the underlying geometry and can achieve higher accuracy than\nexisting methods. To solve this optimization problem efficiently, we introduce\nan as-rigid-as-possible regulation term to estimate the deformed normals and\npropose an alternating minimization solver using a majorization-minimization\nstrategy. Moreover, for effective initialization of the solver, we incorporate\na deformation graph-based coarse alignment that improves registration quality\nand efficiency. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method greatly\nimproves the accuracy of non-rigid registration problems and maintains\nrelatively high solution efficiency.

    "title": "Millisecond-Response Tracking and Gazing System for UAVs: A Domestic   Solution Based on \"Phytium + Cambricon\"",
    "summary": "In the frontier research and application of current video surveillance\ntechnology, traditional camera systems exhibit significant limitations of\nresponse delay exceeding 200 ms in dynamic scenarios due to the insufficient\ndeep feature extraction capability of automatic recognition algorithms and the\nefficiency bottleneck of computing architectures, failing to meet the real-time\nrequirements in complex scenes. To address this issue, this study proposes a\nheterogeneous computing architecture based on Phytium processors and Cambricon\naccelerator cards, constructing a UAV tracking and gazing system with\nmillisecond-level response capability. At the hardware level, the system adopts\na collaborative computing architecture of Phytium FT-2000/4 processors and\nMLU220 accelerator cards, enhancing computing power through multi-card\nparallelism. At the software level, it innovatively integrates a lightweight\nYOLOv5s detection network with a DeepSORT cascaded tracking algorithm, forming\na closed-loop control chain of \"detection-tracking-feedback\". Experimental\nresults demonstrate that the system achieves a stable single-frame\ncomprehensive processing delay of 50-100 ms in 1920*1080 resolution video\nstream processing, with a multi-scale target recognition accuracy of over\n98.5%, featuring both low latency and high precision. This study provides an\ninnovative solution for UAV monitoring and the application of domestic chips.",

    "title": "HLG: Comprehensive 3D Room Construction via Hierarchical Layout   Generation",
    "summary": "Realistic 3D indoor scene generation is crucial for virtual reality, interior\ndesign, embodied intelligence, and scene understanding. While existing methods\nhave made progress in coarse-scale furniture arrangement, they struggle to\ncapture fine-grained object placements, limiting the realism and utility of\ngenerated environments. This gap hinders immersive virtual experiences and\ndetailed scene comprehension for embodied AI applications. To address these\nissues, we propose Hierarchical Layout Generation (HLG), a novel method for\nfine-grained 3D scene generation. HLG is the first to adopt a coarse-to-fine\nhierarchical approach, refining scene layouts from large-scale furniture\nplacement to intricate object arrangements. Specifically, our fine-grained\nlayout alignment module constructs a hierarchical layout through vertical and\nhorizontal decoupling, effectively decomposing complex 3D indoor scenes into\nmultiple levels of granularity. Additionally, our trainable layout optimization\nnetwork addresses placement issues, such as incorrect positioning, orientation\nerrors, and object intersections, ensuring structurally coherent and physically\nplausible scene generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach\nthrough extensive experiments, showing superior performance in generating\nrealistic indoor scenes compared to existing methods. This work advances the\nfield of scene generation and opens new possibilities for applications\nrequiring detailed 3D environments. We will release our code upon publication\nto encourage future research.",

    "title": "Learning from Majority Label: A Novel Problem in Multi-class   Multiple-Instance Learning",
    "summary": "The paper proposes a novel multi-class Multiple-Instance Learning (MIL)\nproblem called Learning from Majority Label (LML). In LML, the majority class\nof instances in a bag is assigned as the bag-level label. The goal of LML is to\ntrain a classification model that estimates the class of each instance using\nthe majority label. This problem is valuable in a variety of applications,\nincluding pathology image segmentation, political voting prediction, customer\nsentiment analysis, and environmental monitoring. To solve LML, we propose a\nCounting Network trained to produce bag-level majority labels, estimated by\ncounting the number of instances in each class. Furthermore, analysis\nexperiments on the characteristics of LML revealed that bags with a high\nproportion of the majority class facilitate learning. Based on this result, we\ndeveloped a Majority Proportion Enhancement Module (MPEM) that increases the\nproportion of the majority class by removing minority class instances within\nthe bags. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method on\nfour datasets compared to conventional MIL methods. Moreover, ablation studies\nconfirmed the effectiveness of each module.

    "summary": "Liver vessel segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging data is important for\nthe computational analysis of vascular remodelling, associated with a wide\nspectrum of diffuse liver diseases. Existing approaches rely on contrast\nenhanced imaging data, but the necessary dedicated imaging sequences are not\nuniformly acquired. Images without contrast enhancement are acquired more\nfrequently, but vessel segmentation is challenging, and requires large-scale\nannotated data. We propose a multi-task learning framework to segment vessels\nin liver MRI without contrast. It exploits auxiliary contrast enhanced MRI data\navailable only during training to reduce the need for annotated training\nexamples. Our approach draws on paired native and contrast enhanced data with\nand without vessel annotations for model training. Results show that auxiliary\ndata improves the accuracy of vessel segmentation, even if they are not\navailable during inference. The advantage is most pronounced if only few\nannotations are available for training, since the feature representation\nbenefits from the shared task structure. A validation of this approach to\naugment a model for brain tumor segmentation confirms its benefits across\ndifferent domains. An auxiliary informative imaging modality can augment expert\nannotations even if it is only available during training.",

    "summary": "Medical tubular anatomical structures are inherently three-dimensional\nconduits with lumens, enclosing walls, and complex branching topologies.\nAccurate reconstruction of their geometry and topology is crucial for\napplications such as bronchoscopic navigation and cerebral arterial\nconnectivity assessment. Existing methods often rely on voxel-wise overlap\nmeasures, which fail to capture topological correctness and completeness.\nAlthough topology-aware losses and persistent homology constraints have shown\npromise, they are usually applied patch-wise and cannot guarantee global\npreservation or correct geometric errors at inference. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel TopoSculpt, a framework for topological\nrefinement of 3D fine-grained tubular structures. TopoSculpt (i) adopts a\nholistic whole-region modeling strategy to capture full spatial context, (ii)\nfirst introduces a Topological Integrity Betti (TIB) constraint that jointly\nenforces Betti number priors and global integrity, and (iii) employs a\ncurriculum refinement scheme with persistent homology to progressively correct\nerrors from coarse to fine scales. Extensive experiments on challenging\npulmonary airway and Circle of Willis datasets demonstrate substantial\nimprovements in both geometry and topology. For instance, $\\beta_{0}$ errors\nare reduced from 69.00 to 3.40 on the airway dataset and from 1.65 to 0.30 on\nthe CoW dataset, with Tree length detected and branch detected rates improving\nby nearly 10\\%.

We propose a largely\nautomated framework that integrates unsupervised and supervised learning\nmethods to classify micrographs according to microstructure phase/class and,\nfor multiphase microstructures, segments them into different homogeneous\nregions. With the advance of manufacturing and imaging techniques, the\nultra-high resolution of imaging that reveals the complexity of microstructures\nand the rapidly increasing quantity of images (i.e., micrographs) enables and\nnecessitates a more powerful and automated framework to extract materials\ncharacteristics and knowledge. The framework we propose can be used to\ngradually build a database of microstructure classes relevant to a particular\nprocess or group of materials, which can help in analyzing and\ndiscovering/identifying new materials. The framework has three steps: (1)\nsegmentation of multiphase micrographs through a recently developed score-based\nmethod so that different microstructure homogeneous regions can be identified\nin an unsupervised manner; (2) {identification and classification of}\nhomogeneous regions of micrographs through an uncertainty-aware supervised\nclassification network trained using the segmented micrographs from Step $1$\nwith their identified labels verified via the built-in uncertainty\nquantification and minimal human inspection; (3) supervised segmentation (more\npowerful than the segmentation in Step $1$) of multiphase microstructures\nthrough a segmentation network trained with micrographs and the results from\nSteps $1$-$2$ using a form of data augmentation.

This shows the need to\ndevelop more event-centric datasets to better understand how harms are\nperpetrated in social media and to develop more aware technologies for their\ndetection.",

A variety of techniques exist for building uplift models,\nand it is essential to understand the model differences in the context of\nintended applications. The uplift curve is a widely adopted tool for assessing\nuplift model performance on the selection universe when observations are\navailable for the entire population. However, when it is uneconomical or\ninfeasible to select the entire population, it becomes difficult or even\nimpossible to estimate the uplift curve without appropriate sampling design.

We assume a sub-quadratic temporal growth condition\nof the variance of the process, which allows for a wide range of temporal\ndependencies. As the growth approaches quadratic, the convergence rate becomes\nslower. This variance assumption is related to the time-reduced factorial\ncovariance measure, and we exemplify its validity for various point processes,\nincluding the Poisson cluster, Hawkes, Neyman-Scott, and log-Gaussian Cox\nprocesses.

However, structural properties of\nthe system dynamics and constraints have the potential to mitigate these\nchallenges. In this paper, we explore how equivariances in the dynamics,\nloosely speaking a form of symmetry, can be leveraged in the CBF synthesis.\nAlthough CBFs are generally not inherently symmetric, we show how equivariances\nin the dynamics and symmetries in the constraints induce symmetries in CBFs\nderived through reachability analysis. This insight allows us to infer their\nCBF values across the entire domain from their values on a subset, leading to\nsignificant computational savings. Interestingly, equivariances can be even\nleveraged to the CBF synthesis for non-symmetric constraints. Specifically, we\nshow how a partially known CBF can be leveraged together with equivariances to\nconstruct a CBF for various new constraints.

    "summary": "Social robots are increasingly recognized as valuable supporters in the field\nof well-being coaching. They can function as independent coaches or provide\nsupport alongside human coaches, and healthcare professionals. In coaching\ninteractions, these robots often handle sensitive information shared by users,\nmaking privacy a relevant issue. Despite this, little is known about the\nfactors that shape users' privacy perceptions. This research aims to examine\nthree key factors systematically: (1) the transparency about information usage,\n(2) the level of specific user control over how the robot uses their\ninformation, and (3) the robot's behavioral approach - whether it acts\nproactively or only responds on demand. Our results from an online study (N =\n200) show that even when users grant the robot general access to personal data,\nthey additionally expect the ability to explicitly control how that information\nis interpreted and shared during sessions. Experimental conditions that\nprovided such control received significantly higher ratings for perceived\nprivacy appropriateness and trust. Compared to user control, the effects of\ntransparency and proactivity on privacy appropriateness perception were low,\nand we found no significant impact. The results suggest that merely informing\nusers or proactive sharing is insufficient without accompanying user control.\nThese insights underscore the need for further research on mechanisms that\nallow users to manage robots' information processing and sharing, especially\nwhen social robots take on more proactive roles alongside humans.",

We propose the Lightweight Actuation Space Energy Modeling\n(LASEM) framework for cable driven continuum robots, which formulates actuation\npotential energy directly in actuation space. LASEM yields an analytical\nforward model derived from geometrically nonlinear beam and rod theories via\nHamilton's principle, while avoiding explicit modeling of cable backbone\ncontact. It accepts both force and displacement inputs, thereby unifying\nkinematic and static formulations. Assuming the friction is neglected, the\nframework generalizes to nonuniform geometries, arbitrary cable routings,\ndistributed loading and axial extensibility, while remaining computationally\nefficient for real-time use. Numerical simulations validate its accuracy, and a\nsemi-analytical iterative scheme is developed for inverse kinematics.

To this end, we propose a computationally\nefficient solution that relies on calculating a focus point in the most\ninformative (unknown) region and having the robot maintain this point in the\ncamera field of view along the path. We incorporated this strategy into the\nwhole-body control of a mobile manipulator employing a visibility constraint\nwithout the need for an additional path planner. We conducted comprehensive and\nrealistic simulations using a large dataset of 114 diverse objects of varying\nsizes from 57 categories to compare our method with a sampling-based planning\nstrategy using Bayesian data analysis. Furthermore, we performed real-world\nexperiments with an 8-DoF mobile manipulator to demonstrate the proposed\nmethod's performance in practice. Our results suggest that there is no\nsignificant difference in object coverage and entropy. In contrast, our method\nis approximately nine times faster than the baseline sampling-based method in\nterms of the average time the robot spends between views.",

Prior systems often flatten\ngarments or assume visibility of key features. We present a dual-arm\nvisuotactile framework that combines confidence-aware dense visual\ncorrespondence and tactile-supervised grasp affordance to operate directly on\ncrumpled and suspended garments. The correspondence model is trained on a\ncustom, high-fidelity simulated dataset using a distributional loss that\ncaptures cloth symmetries and generates correspondence confidence estimates.\nThese estimates guide a reactive state machine that adapts folding strategies\nbased on perceptual uncertainty. In parallel, a visuotactile grasp affordance\nnetwork, self-supervised using high-resolution tactile feedback, determines\nwhich regions are physically graspable. The same tactile classifier is used\nduring execution for real-time grasp validation. By deferring action in\nlow-confidence states, the system handles highly occluded table-top and in-air\nconfigurations. We demonstrate our task-agnostic grasp selection module in\nfolding and hanging tasks. Moreover, our dense descriptors provide a reusable\nintermediate representation for other planning modalities, such as extracting\ngrasp targets from human video demonstrations, paving the way for more\ngeneralizable and scalable garment manipulation.",

However, achieving this can be\nchallenging due to the temporal and kinematic diversity of the motions, the\npolicy's capability, and the difficulty of coordination of the upper and lower\nbodies. To address these issues, we propose GMT, a general and scalable\nmotion-tracking framework that trains a single unified policy to enable\nhumanoid robots to track diverse motions in the real world. GMT is built upon\ntwo core components: an Adaptive Sampling strategy and a Motion\nMixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture. The Adaptive Sampling automatically\nbalances easy and difficult motions during training. The MoE ensures better\nspecialization of different regions of the motion manifold. We show through\nextensive experiments in both simulation and the real world the effectiveness\nof GMT, achieving state-of-the-art performance across a broad spectrum of\nmotions using a unified general policy.

We present a new approach to\npersonalise the ranking of the tweets toward solving the problem of information\noverload which is achieved by analysing the relationship between the importance\nof tweets to the frequency at which the author tweets. The hypothesis tested is\nthat \"low-frequency tweeters have more to say\", i.e. if a user who tweets\ninfrequently actually goes to the effort of tweeting, then it is more likely to\nbe of more importance or contain more \"meaning\" than a tweet by a user who\ntweets continuously. We propose six new measures to evaluate the importance of\ntweets based on the ability of the tweet to drive interaction among its\nreaders, which is measured through metrics such as retweets, favourites, and\ncomments, and the extent of the author's network interacting with the tweet.\nOur study shows that users who tweeted less than ten tweets per week were more\nlikely to be perceived as important by their followers and have the most\nimportant messages. This identified tweet-frequency band could be used to\nreorder the activity feed of users and such reordering would ensure the\nmessages of low-frequency tweeters do not get lost in the stream of tweets.\nThis could also serve as a scoring index for Twitter users to identify users\nfrequently tweeting important messages.",

    "title": "dsld: A Socially Relevant Tool for Teaching Statistics",
    "summary": "The growing influence of data science in statistics education requires tools\nthat make key concepts accessible through real-world applications. We introduce\n\"Data Science Looks At Discrimination\" (dsld), an R package that provides a\ncomprehensive set of analytical and graphical methods for examining issues of\ndiscrimination involving attributes such as race, gender, and age. By\npositioning fairness analysis as a teaching tool, the package enables\ninstructors to demonstrate confounder effects, model bias, and related topics\nthrough applied examples. An accompanying 80-page Quarto book guides students\nand legal professionals in understanding these principles and applying them to\nreal data. We describe the implementation of the package functions and\nillustrate their use with examples. Python interfaces are also available.",
