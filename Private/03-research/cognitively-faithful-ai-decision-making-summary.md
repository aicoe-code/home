### Executive Summary **[Required]**
This research proposes a novel framework for developing AI decision-making models that more closely mimic human cognitive processes to improve AI alignment. The authors analyze the gap between current AI decision-making approaches and human cognitive strategies, introducing methodological insights for creating cognitively faithful AI models that better understand and replicate context-dependent human decision-making patterns.

---

### Research Context **[Required]**

#### Problem Statement
Current AI decision-making models often diverge significantly from human cognitive processes, creating alignment challenges when AI systems need to understand, predict, or collaborate with human decision-makers in complex real-world scenarios.

#### Research Questions
1. How can AI decision-making models be designed to more accurately reflect human cognitive processes?
2. What cognitive heuristics and strategies are essential for creating aligned AI systems?
3. How can mathematical modeling capture context-dependent human decision-making strategies?

#### Relevance to AICOE Mission
